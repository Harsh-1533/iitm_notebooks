    "In **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**, indexes are critical for improving query performance. There are several **types of indexes**, categorized by how they organize data, whether they are ordered or hashed, and how they relate to the data file.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.1. **Primary Index (Clustered Index)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built on a field that **determines the physical (sequential) order** of the data file.\n",
    "* Usually built on the **primary key**, but not necessarily.\n",
    "* Only **one primary (clustered) index** per table.\n",
    "* Example: File is sorted by `Employee_ID`, and primary index is built on `Employee_ID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Type:** Ordered, Dense or Sparse\n",
    "âœ… **Also called:** Clustered Index\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. **Secondary Index (Non-clustered Index)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built on fields **other than** the one used to order the data.\n",
    "* Data file remains unordered with respect to this field.\n",
    "* Supports **multiple** indexes on the same file.\n",
    "* Required to be **dense**.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Type:** Ordered, Always Dense\n",
    "âœ… **Also called:** Non-clustered Index\n",

    "## ðŸ”· **2. Based on Index Density**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. **Dense Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contains **one index entry for every record** in the data file.\n",
    "* Quick access, but takes more space and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Used in:** Secondary Indexes, Dense Primary Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. **Sparse Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contains entries for **only some of the records** (e.g., first record of every block).\n",
    "* Saves space, but slower access (needs linear scan in block).\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Used in:** Primary Indexes, Block-level Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· **3. Based on Indexing Technique**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. **Ordered Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Index entries are **sorted** on the search key.\n",
    "* Allows **binary search** and range queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Includes:** Primary, Secondary, Dense, Sparse Indexes\n",
    "âœ… **Used in:** ISAM, B+ Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. **Hash Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses a **hash function** to map search keys to buckets.\n",
    "* Entries are **not sorted**.\n",
    "* Very efficient for **equality searches**, but not for range queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Type:** Unordered\n",
    "âœ… **Used in:** Hash-based storage structures (e.g., Extendible Hashing)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· **4. Based on Number of Index Levels**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. **Single-Level Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* One index file directly maps keys to data records or blocks.\n",
    "* Simple but not scalable for very large databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2. **Multi-Level Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Index built **on top of another index**.\n",
    "* Helps manage large indexes that donâ€™t fit in memory.\n",
    "* Usually, **outer index is sparse**, **inner index is dense**.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Used in:** B+ Tree structures\n",

    "\n",
    "### 5.1. **Composite Index (Concatenated Index)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built on **multiple attributes** (e.g., `name + dob`).\n",
    "* Efficient for queries involving all or leading subset of those fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2. **Unique Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enforces **uniqueness** on the index field.\n",
    "* Often automatically created on **primary key** fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3. **Bitmap Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses **bitmaps** for attribute values (0s and 1s).\n",
    "* Best suited for **low-cardinality attributes** (e.g., gender, status).\n",
    "* Used in **data warehousing** and **analytical queries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4. **Function-based Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Index created on a **function of one or more columns** (e.g., `UPPER(name)`).\n",
    "* Useful for queries that use computed columns.\n",
