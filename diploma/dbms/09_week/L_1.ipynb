    "## 🧠 Why Do We Need Indexing?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A database table (e.g., faculty with `name` and `phone_number`) is stored as a file of records.\n",
    "* Searching for a record by `name` or `phone_number` requires a **linear scan (O(n))**, unless sorted.\n",
    "* Sorting on one attribute means efficient search only for that one (via **binary search** O(log n)), but not the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can't sort on multiple fields simultaneously.\n",
    "* Sorting complicates `insert` and `delete` operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **indexing** to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Allow **fast search (O(log n))** even when data is **unsorted**.\n",
    "  * Create **separate index structures** for different fields (e.g., one for name, one for phone number).\n",
    "  * Enable efficient **multi-attribute search** without disturbing physical data layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 What is Indexing?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing is a technique to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table by using **auxiliary lookup structures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Index File:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **separate table** storing selected field values and their corresponding **record pointers**.\n",
    "* Allows quick binary search using **sorted keys**, independent of main data file order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Indexed Sequential Access Mechanism (ISAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Core Idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep **main data file unordered**.\n",
    "* Maintain one or more **sorted index files** with key + pointer to actual record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Main file: faculty(name, phone)\n",
    "* Index file 1: sorted by `name`, points to record number in main file\n",
    "* Index file 2: sorted by `phone_number`, same structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can search any field (name/phone) in O(log n) if indexed.\n",
    "* Doesn’t change the original data layout.\n",
    "* Can create **multiple indexes** on different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏷️ Types of Indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Primary Index (Clustering Index)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applied when **main data file is sorted** based on the search key.\n",
    "* Search key is often the **primary key**, but not necessarily.\n",
    "* One entry per **data block** or **record**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Secondary Index (Non-clustering Index)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applied when data file is **not sorted** based on the search key.\n",
    "* Supports **non-primary key fields** (e.g., `salary`, `department_name`).\n",
    "* Always **dense**, since no sorting exists in the main file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Dense vs Sparse Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Dense Index:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contains **every search key value** with its corresponding pointer.\n",
    "* E.g., all names or all phone numbers.\n",
    "* Pros: Fast access.\n",
    "* Cons: Large size, higher maintenance cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Sparse Index:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contains only **some search key values**, e.g., **1 out of every 5** entries.\n",
    "* Usually used on **sorted (primary) index**.\n",
    "* Trade-off between space and speed.\n",
    "* Needs **extra linear scan** within block if the key is not found in index.\n",
    "* Typically stores pointer to **first record of each block**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Block-Level Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Index on the **first record of each block**.\n",
    "* Enables fast identification of **likely block** containing the key.\n",
    "* Once block is found, linear or other search is done inside the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Secondary Index with Duplicate Values\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When multiple records have **same search key** (e.g., salary = 80000).\n",
    "* Index must store **pointers to all such records**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **one entry per search key value**, pointing to a **list** of record addresses.\n",
    "* Helps avoid repetition in index file.\n",
    "* Example: `80000 → [record_3, record_7]`\n",

    "### 🔹 Secondary Index:\n",
