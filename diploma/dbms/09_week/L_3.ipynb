    "### What is a 2-3-4 Tree?\n",
    "- A **balanced multi-way search tree** with **3 types of nodes**:\n",
    "  - **2-node**: 1 key, 2 children\n",
    "  - **3-node**: 2 keys, 3 children\n",
    "  - **4-node**: 3 keys, 4 children\n",
    "- **All leaf nodes are at the same depth** ‚Äì ensures balanced structure.\n",

    "### Definition\n",
    "A **B+ Tree** is a **balanced multi-level index tree** where:\n",
    "- All paths from the root to leaves have the **same length**\n",
    "- The **leaf nodes contain the actual data** (or pointers to records)\n",
    "- The **internal nodes only contain keys and child pointers**\n",
    "- **Leaf nodes are linked** sequentially (for range queries)\n",
    "- **Sorted order is preserved** in the leaf nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Balanced** | Height is always log-based, ensuring fast search |\n",
    "| **Multi-level Indexing** | Uses internal nodes for routing, leaves for data |\n",
    "| **Linked Leaves** | Leaf nodes are linked via pointers for sequential access |\n",
    "| **Sorted Leaf Keys** | Allows both binary search and range scan |\n",
    "| **Single Structure for Index & Records** | Can be used for index files or full records |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Trade-off in `n` (max keys/pointers per node):\n",
    "- **Larger `n`**:\n",
    "  - Fewer tree levels ‚áí **smaller height**\n",
    "  - **More comparisons** per node (linear scan within node)\n",
    "  - **May not fit in memory block**\n",
    "- **Smaller `n`**:\n",
    "  - More tree levels ‚áí **greater height**\n",
    "  - **Fewer comparisons**, but **more disk accesses**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Balance Rule:\n",
    "- Every **internal node** must be **at least half full**:\n",
    "  - At least `‚åàn/2‚åâ` keys and `‚åàn/2‚åâ + 1` pointers\n",
    "- **Root node** can be an exception (can have fewer keys)\n",
    "- **Leaf nodes** also must be at least half full\n",
    "- Leaf nodes also carry a **pointer to next leaf**\n",

    "## üîé 4. Searching in a B+ Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure:\n",
    "1. Start from **root**\n",
    "2. At each internal node:\n",
    "   - Use **linear search** on keys to find correct child pointer\n",
    "3. Traverse down to **leaf node**\n",
    "4. **Search within leaf** to find key (or determine absence)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Searching for key 55:\n",
    "- Root: Compare against keys ‚Üí route down\n",
    "- Internal node: Compare ‚Üí go to leaf\n",
    "- Leaf node: Linear search ‚Üí find 55\n",

    "## ‚úçÔ∏è 5. Insertion in B+ Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Search** for the location in the appropriate **leaf node**\n",
    "2. If **space exists**, insert in sorted order\n",
    "3. If **no space**:\n",
    "   - **Split** the node into two (half-half split)\n",
    "   - **Promote** the first key of the new right node to the parent\n",
    "4. If parent is full, **repeat split recursively**\n",
    "5. May cause **tree height to increase**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties Maintained:\n",
    "- Nodes are **at least half full**\n",
    "- **Sorted order** preserved\n",
    "- All **leaf nodes stay at same level**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## ‚ùå 6. Deletion in B+ Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Search** and delete the key from leaf\n",
    "2. If **leaf becomes under-full**:\n",
    "   - **Borrow** from sibling (if possible)\n",
    "   - Else, **merge with sibling** and **adjust parent**\n",
    "3. May **propagate upwards** (if parent becomes under-full)\n",
    "4. **Tree height may decrease**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties Maintained:\n",
    "- Minimum occupancy maintained\n",
    "- All leaves remain at same depth\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üå≥ 7. Performance Analysis\n",

    "### Tree Height:\n",
    "- For `K` keys, node capacity `n`, tree height ‚âà `log‚Ççn/2‚Çé(K)`\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - `K = 10‚Å∂`, `n = 100` ‚áí height ‚âà log‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ(10‚Å∂) ‚âà 4\n",
    "  - A binary tree would need log‚ÇÇ(10‚Å∂) ‚âà 20 levels\n",

    "  - **Index files**\n",
    "  - **Record files (actual data)**\n",
    "- Hence, it's a **self-organizing data structure**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Approaches:\n",
    "- **Relax strict inequality** in search to allow duplicates\n",
    "- Keep **list of record pointers** for same key\n",
    "- Or make key **unique** by appending a **record ID**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß∑ 10. Storage Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Record Pointer Overhead:\n",
    "- At leaf level, pointers to actual records stored\n",
    "- If records **relocate**, all affected pointers must be updated ‚áí costly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solutions:\n",
    "- Use **primary index key** in secondary indexes instead of record pointer\n",
    "  - Saves cost of update during relocation\n",
    "  - Increases query time slightly but is amortized\n",

    "### Issues:\n",
    "- **Variable-length keys** ‚áí **variable fan-out**\n",
    "- Makes balancing harder\n",

    "### Solution:\n",
    "- Use **prefix compression**\n",
    "  - e.g., ‚ÄúSilas‚Äù and ‚ÄúSilberschatz‚Äù ‚áí compressed prefix ‚ÄúSilb‚Äù\n",
    "  - Reduces space without compromising uniqueness\n",

    "- **Internal nodes** contain keys and child pointers\n",
    "- **Leaf nodes** contain keys, record pointers, and **next leaf pointer**\n",
