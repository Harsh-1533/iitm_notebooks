    "### **Indexing and Hashing/4: Hashing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subject:** Database Management Systems (DBMS)\n",
    "**Course:** IIT Madras Online B.Sc.\n",
    "**Learning Outcomes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore various hashing schemes – Static and Dynamic Hashing\n",
    "2. Compare Ordered Indexing and Hashing\n",
    "3. Understand Bitmap Indices\n",

    "## 🌐 1. Introduction to Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hashing is an **alternative to ordered indexing** to support efficient search.\n",
    "* Goal: Access data quickly by transforming the search key into a bucket address.\n",
    "* The **domain (D)** of possible key values is large (e.g., 27²⁰ for 20-letter names), but **actual data used is small**.\n",
    "* Hashing involves applying a **hash function (h)** that maps large domain D → a smaller set of bucket indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔒 2. Static Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ What is Static Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hash function `h(k)` maps keys to a **fixed number of buckets**.\n",
    "* Each bucket corresponds to a disk block.\n",
    "* A **bucket** stores one or more records.\n",
    "* Common hash function:\n",
    "  `hash_value = (ASCII_sum(key)) % N`\n",
    "  where N is the number of buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keys: `\"Music\"`, `\"History\"`, `\"Computer Science\"`\n",
    "* `ASCII_sum(\"Music\") % 10 = 1` → Goes to bucket 1\n",
    "* Collisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `\"Physics\"` and `\"Electrical\"` both hash to bucket 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❗ Collisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When two distinct keys map to the same bucket → **collision**\n",
    "* Must search **sequentially** inside the bucket to locate the desired record.\n",
    "* Causes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Large domain, small bucket range\n",
    "  * Skewed distribution of key values\n",
    "  * Inherent data duplication (e.g., many instructors in one department)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧰 Handling Collisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **overflow buckets** to handle cases where a bucket exceeds capacity.\n",
    "* Structure becomes a **linked chain of blocks**.\n",
    "* Downsides:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Increased I/O cost**\n",
    "  * **Poor performance** as chain lengthens\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Ideal Hash Function Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniform distribution** of keys to buckets\n",
    "2. **Minimize collisions**\n",
    "3. **Balance between bucket usage and overflow**\n",
    "4. Ideal: Random function → uniform bucket sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Static Hashing Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pros                     | Cons                                  |\n",
    "| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Simple, fast lookup      | Fixed number of buckets limits growth |\n",
    "| Good for static datasets | Collisions and overflow chaining      |\n",
    "| Low maintenance          | Poor handling of data skew or growth  |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 3. Dynamic Hashing (Extendable Hashing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ Why Dynamic?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Static hashing fails for **growing databases**\n",
    "* Either:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Under-allocate (leads to overflow)\n",
    "  * Over-allocate (wastes space)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌲 Key Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a **large-range hash function** (e.g., 32-bit → 2³² buckets)\n",
    "2. **Only use a prefix of hash bits** to identify actual bucket\n",
    "3. Adjust the number of prefix bits (`i`) **dynamically** based on data size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Global depth (i):** Number of hash prefix bits currently used\n",
    "* **Bucket Address Table (BAT):** Maps i-bit prefixes → bucket pointers\n",
    "* **Local depth:** Number of bits used to index a specific bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hash value = `h(k)` → binary\n",
    "2. Use `i` bits from the beginning of hash to index BAT\n",
    "3. BAT entry → bucket (which stores records)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Insertion:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If bucket is full:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. If local depth < global depth:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Split the bucket\n",
    "     * Share BAT entries\n",
    "  2. If local depth == global depth:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Double** the BAT (increase i by 1)\n",
    "     * Split the full bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧺 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Insert keys: Mozart (Music), Srinivasan (CS), Wu (Finance)\n",
    "* Hash prefixes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Music → `0` → Bucket 0\n",
    "  * CS, Finance → `1` → Bucket 1\n",
    "* Add Einstein (Physics), also → `1` → Overflow\n",
    "* Increase `i` from 1 → 2\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Reorganize: CS → 11, Physics & Finance → 10\n",
    "* Continue adding: History, Gold, El Said, Brand...\n",
    "* Use overflow bucket if splitting is inefficient\n",

    "## 🧩 5. Bitmap Indices\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ What are Bitmap Indices?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suitable for attributes with **limited distinct values** (e.g., gender, country, income group)\n",
    "* Replace repeated attribute values with **bit vectors**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each value of an attribute → create a **bit array** of size = number of records\n",
    "* For each record, set:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 1 if the attribute equals that value\n",
    "  * 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 👨 Example: Gender (Male/Female)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Record | Gender |\n",
    "| ------ | ------ |\n",
    "| R1     | Male   |\n",
    "| R2     | Female |\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Male bitmap**: `1 0 0 1`\n",
    "* **Female bitmap**: `0 1 1 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Boolean Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Queries can be done using **bitwise operations**\n",
    "* Example: `(Gender = Male) AND (Income = Level 3)`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * AND male bitmap with income bitmap → result points to matching records\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Space-efficient for low-cardinality attributes\n",
    "* Very fast for **logical combination queries**\n",
    "* Enables parallelized searching using bitwise ops\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚫 Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not suitable for high-cardinality fields (e.g., names, unique IDs)\n",
