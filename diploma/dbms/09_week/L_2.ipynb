    "1. Recap **Balanced Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** as optimal in-memory search data structures.\n",
    "2. Understand challenges with **external search data structures** for persistent data.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 📌 **Search Time Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary Search Tree (BST) search time: **O(h)** where `h = height of the tree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Best case: **O(log n)** (balanced tree).\n",
    "  * Worst case: **O(n)** (skewed/unbalanced tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repeated inserts/deletes without balancing may increase `h` up to `n`.\n",
    "* A skewed tree degrades search to **linear time**, defeating BST purpose.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 💡 **Randomization Strategy**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",

    "1. **Search** for correct leaf node.\n",
    "2. Three scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Insert into a 2-node → becomes 3-node.\n",
    "   * Insert into a 3-node → becomes 4-node.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Middle key promoted to parent.\n",
    "* 2 new child nodes created:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Left node with left key.\n",
    "  * Right node with right key.\n",
    "* Parent may:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Be 2-node → becomes 3-node.\n",
    "  * Be 3-node → becomes 4-node (may trigger further splits).\n",
    "  * Be root → new root created → **height increases by 1**.\n",

    "* Both strategies yield same **asymptotic performance** (O(log n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✏️ **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert sequence: `10, 30, 60, 20, 50, 40, 70, 80, 15, 90, 100`\n",

    "### 💡 **Optimization Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **uniform node size** (4-node).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Insert fewer keys.\n",
    "  * Some space may be wasted → acceptable trade-off for performance.\n",
