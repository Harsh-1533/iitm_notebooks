    "### üîÑ Decomposition into 3NF\n",

    "\n",
    "* Each $R_i$ is in 3NF\n",
    "* The decomposition is lossless\n",
    "* All FDs in $F$ are preserved\n",

    "#### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute the Canonical Cover (Fc)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Minimize FDs: split right-hand sides, remove extraneous attributes and redundant FDs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Relations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For each FD $X \n",
    "     ightarrow A \\in Fc$, create a relation schema $R_i = X \\cup \\{A\\}$\n",
