    "\n",
    "This module focuses on understanding the **Normal Forms** in Relational Database Design. It builds on the **Functional Dependency (FD) theory**, **lossless join**, and **dependency preservation**, with an aim to reduce **redundancy** and avoid **anomalies** (insertion, deletion, update).\n",

    "### ðŸŽ“ Why Normalization?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal**: Eliminate redundancy & anomalies, and ensure sensible data dependency\n",
    "* **Approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Start with an unnormalized schema\n",
    "  * Decompose step-by-step\n",
    "  * Ensure at each stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Atomic values\n",
    "    * No partial dependencies\n",
    "    * No transitive dependencies\n",
    "    * Lossless join\n",

    "### ðŸ”Ž Anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Insertion Anomaly**: Can't insert without unnecessary data\n",
    "* **Deletion Anomaly**: Deleting a record removes important info\n",
    "* **Update Anomaly**: Updating in one place requires updating many other places\n",

    "#### âœ… First Normal Form (1NF):\n",
    "\n",
    "* All attribute domains contain **atomic values** (indivisible)\n",
    "* No multi-valued or composite attributes\n",
    "* **Example Issue**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Student with multiple course names in one field violates 1NF\n",
    "  * Convert to separate rows to enforce 1NF\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Second Normal Form (2NF):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must be in 1NF\n",
    "* **No Partial Dependencies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A non-prime attribute (not part of any candidate key) should not depend on a **part of a candidate key**\n",
    "  * **Partial Dependency**: X â†’ A, where X is part of a candidate key, and A is non-prime\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Schema: (SID, Cname, Sname), where (SID, Cname) is key\n",
    "  * FD: SID â†’ Sname\n",
    "  * Here, Sname depends only on SID (part of key), hence partial dependency\n",
    "  * **Solution**: Decompose into:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * R1(SID, Sname)\n",
    "    * R2(SID, Cname)\n",
    "* Ensures **lossless join** and **dependency preservation**\n",

    "#### âœ… Third Normal Form (3NF):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must be in 2NF\n",
    "* **No Transitive Dependencies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A non-prime attribute should not be transitively dependent on a key\n",
    "  * **Transitive Dependency**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * A â†’ B, B â†’ C implies A â†’ C is transitive\n",
    "  * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Book â†’ Author, Author â†’ Nationality âž” Book â†’ Nationality (transitive)\n",
    "  * FD Rule: For A â†’ B, either:\n",

    "    * R1(SID, City)\n",

    "### ðŸ“š Real-world Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most real-world designs aim for **3NF**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Easy to model\n",
    "  * Covers majority of use cases\n",
    "  * BCNF and higher forms (4NF, 5NF, 6NF) are used only when strictly necessary\n",

    "* **3NF** = 1NF + 2NF + No Transitive Dependency\n",
