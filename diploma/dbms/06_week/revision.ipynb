    "\n",
    "## **1. First Normal Form (1NF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The domain of each attribute must contain only **atomic (indivisible) values**.\n",
    "* There are **no repeating groups or arrays**.\n",
    "* Each record must be unique (tuples are distinct).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "❌ `PhoneNumbers = {12345, 67890}` (multi-valued)\n",
    "✅ Split into separate rows or columns, each cell has a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Second Normal Form (2NF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must be in **1NF**, and\n",
    "* **No partial dependency:** No non-prime attribute (non-key attribute) should depend on a **part of a composite candidate key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the relation has a single attribute candidate key, 2NF is automatically satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "❌ In `Student(CourseID, StudentID, CourseName)`: `CourseID → CourseName` depends only on part of composite key `(CourseID, StudentID)`.\n",
    "✅ Move `CourseID → CourseName` to a separate table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Third Normal Form (3NF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must be in **2NF**, and\n",
    "* **No transitive dependency:** A non-prime attribute must not depend on another non-prime attribute.\n",
    "* Equivalently: For every FD `X → Y`, either:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. X is a superkey, or\n",
    "  2. Each attribute in Y is a prime attribute (part of some candidate key).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "❌ `StudentID → DeptID → DeptName` (DeptName depends on DeptID, which depends on StudentID).\n",
    "✅ Remove transitive dependency by separating Department info.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stronger than 3NF.\n",
    "* For every FD `X → Y`, **X must be a superkey**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key difference from 3NF:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3NF allows FDs where RHS is prime even if LHS is not a superkey.\n",
    "* BCNF does **not** allow that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "❌ `Non-superkey → attribute`, even if RHS is prime.\n",
    "✅ Decompose relation.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must be in **BCNF**, and\n",
    "* **No non-trivial multi-valued dependencies (MVDs)** except those that are implied by candidate keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If `Student →→ Course` and `Student →→ Hobby` (independent sets), this violates 4NF because MVDs lead to unnecessary combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Fifth Normal Form (5NF) / Project-Join Normal Form (PJNF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must be in **4NF**, and\n",
    "* The relation cannot be decomposed into smaller relations **without losing data or introducing spurious tuples**.\n",
    "* All possible join dependencies must be implied by candidate keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If a table can be losslessly split into three or more tables and then recombined using joins, you must do so.\n",
