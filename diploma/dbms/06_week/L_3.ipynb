    "\n",
    "The goal is to design a relational database schema for an **Institute Library Information System (LIS)** based on a natural language specification document. The core objective is to develop a schema that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is derived using **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**\n",
    "* Is transformed into relational schemas\n",
    "* Satisfies **BCNF**, or at minimum, **3NF**\n",
    "* Supports efficient **querying and constraint enforcement**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Key Functional Requirements (Extracted from Specification)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Library manages a large number of **books** and **members**\n",
    "* Books are **issued** and **returned** by members\n",
    "* Each **book** has: title, authors (first author recorded), publisher, year, ISBN (unique per title), accession number (unique per physical copy)\n",
    "* Multiple copies of the same book exist\n",
    "* **Members** can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Undergraduate students\n",
    "  * Postgraduate students\n",
    "  * Research scholars\n",
    "  * Faculty members\n",

    "  * Roll number (for students)\n",
    "  * ID (for faculty)\n",
    "  * Membership number (unique for all)\n",
    "* Member **quotas** specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Number of books allowed\n",
    "  * Time duration per issued book\n",
    "* Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A book can only be issued if it is not already issued\n",
    "  * A member cannot issue multiple copies of the same book\n",
    "  * No books can be issued if member has overdue books\n",
    "  * Quota rules must be respected\n",
