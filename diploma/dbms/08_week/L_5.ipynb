    "### **1. Organization of Database Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hierarchical Containment Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Database** → Collection of **Files**\n",
    "* **File** → Sequence of **Records**\n",
    "* **Record** → Sequence of **Fields**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Assumptions for Simplicity (Initial Model)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fixed-size records\n",
    "* Records of only one type per file\n",
    "* One file per relation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Block-based Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disk storage is partitioned into **fixed-length blocks**\n",
    "* Records must not cross block boundaries\n",
    "* Blocks are the basic unit for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data allocation\n",
    "  * Data transfer\n",

    "### **2. Record Management Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Fixed-Length Records**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stored linearly like arrays\n",
    "* Access via offsets: `i-th record = base_address + i * record_size`\n",
    "* Records must not span multiple blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Deletion Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Move all records after the deleted one up\n",
    "   * Costly and inefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Swap with Last Record**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Replace the deleted record with the last one\n",
    "   * Simpler but changes order\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Free List** *(Most Common)*\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Maintain deleted record addresses in a chain\n",
    "   * Stored in the file header and reused for insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Variable-Length Records**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fields may include types like `VARCHAR` (varying size)\n",
    "* Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Fixed-length section (offsets to variable data)\n",
    "  * Variable-length data appended after fixed section\n",
    "  * Null values managed via **null bitmap**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **3. Slotted Page Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used to manage multiple variable-size records in a block\n",
    "* **Page Header** includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Number of record entries\n",
    "  * End of free space\n",
    "  * Offsets and sizes of each record\n",
    "* Allows internal rearrangement for efficiency\n",
    "* External references remain unchanged due to indirection via header\n",

    "### **4. File Organization Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Heap File**\n",
    "\n",
    "* No ordering\n",
    "* Records inserted wherever space is available\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Sequential File**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ordered by a **search key**\n",
    "* Efficient for binary search and range queries\n",
    "* May need **overflow blocks** for insertions\n",
    "* May require **reorganization** periodically\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Multi-Table Clustering**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores records from different relations together based on relationships\n",
    "* Good for queries involving joins or many-to-one relationships\n",
    "* **Example:** Grouping `instructor` records under each `department`\n",
    "* Drawback: Not optimal for queries targeting only one relation\n",
    "* Results in **variable-length** records and potential data type handling issues\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Data Dictionary (System Catalog)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stores **metadata** (data about data)\n",
    "* Essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Relation definitions\n",
    "  * Attribute types and positions\n",
    "  * Indexes\n",
    "  * Users, roles, and permissions\n",
    "* Should reside in **main memory** for fast access\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Typical Metadata Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relation Metadata**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Relation name, number of attributes, storage details\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attribute Metadata**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Attribute name, domain type, position, length\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Index Metadata**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Index name, relation name, indexed attributes\n",
    "\n",

    "### **6. Access Mechanism and Buffer Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Memory Hierarchy**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disk (slow, large) → Buffer (RAM, fast, small) → CPU\n",
    "* **Block Transfer** from disk to buffer for operations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Buffer Management Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Program requests a block\n",
    "2. Buffer manager checks if block exists in buffer\n",
    "3. If not:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Space is created by removing an old block\n",
    "   * Block is read from disk to buffer\n",
    "   * Modified blocks are written back (if necessary)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Replacement Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LRU (Least Recently Used)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Replace block not used for longest time\n",
    "  * Works well generally, but has limitations (e.g., nested loop joins)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Buffer Control Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pinned Blocks**: Cannot be replaced until unpinned\n",
    "* **Toss Immediate**: Reclaim block space right after use\n",
    "* **MRU (Most Recently Used)**: Used after processing block\n",
    "* **Forced Output**: Used for recovery operations\n",
    "\n",

    "* Understanding of file structures: heap, sequential, and clustered\n",
    "* Managing records: fixed vs variable length, deletion, and compaction\n",
    "* Slotted page structure for internal record management\n",
    "* Metadata management via data dictionary\n",
    "* Efficient buffer management to optimize disk access\n",
