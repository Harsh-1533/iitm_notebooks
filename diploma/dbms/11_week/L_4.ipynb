    "\n",
    "## **1. Recovery with Early Lock Release**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Earlier focus**: Recovery at the transaction level (undo/redo of read/write operations).\n",
    "* **Reality**: At the physical storage level (disk), recovery also involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data files\n",
    "  * Index files (e.g., B+ Trees)\n",
    "  * Other system data structures\n",
    "* These structures require their own concurrency control and recovery mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 The Situation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Write operation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data written in memory (buffer).\n",
    "  * Buffer Manager eventually flushes the block to disk.\n",
    "* **Concurrency issues**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Multiple buffers can be written concurrently.\n",
    "  * For **indices (B+ Trees)**, concurrency control algorithms allow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Concurrent read/write\n",
    "    * Shared/exclusive locks\n",
    "  * To increase throughput, **locks may be released early** (before transaction commit).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Early Lock Release**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: Releasing a low-level lock on a resource (e.g., a B+ Tree node) before the transaction completes.\n",
    "* **Reason**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * B+ Tree is a **centralized resource** accessed by many transactions.\n",
    "  * Holding locks until transaction commit (2-phase locking) → throughput drops.\n",
    "  * Early release lets other transactions update the same node sooner.\n",
    "* **How it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Lock is held only for the duration of updating the node.\n",
    "  * Released immediately after the update, not tied to transaction commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.4 Example Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **T1** inserts `(V1, R1)` into a B+ Tree node.\n",
    "* Lock is released **before T1 completes**.\n",
    "* **T2** inserts `(V2, R2)` into the same node **before T1 commits**.\n",
    "* Consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Node contents and structure may change (splits, shifts).\n",
    "  * Position of `(V1, R1)` may move before T1 finishes.\n",
    "  * If T1 is rolled back:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * A *physical undo* (restore old node value) would also remove `(V2, R2)` from T2 — **wrong**, because T2 might have committed.\n",
    "    * This creates a new inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.5 Logical Undo**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Solution**: Instead of restoring old node physically, undo by a **logical operation**.\n",
    "* **Concept**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Undo insert by performing a delete.\n",
    "  * Undo delete by performing an insert.\n",
    "* **Terminology**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Logical Undo Logging**: Records the *operation* needed to logically reverse the original action.\n",
    "  * **Physical Undo Logging**: Records the *old value* to restore the exact prior state.\n",
    "* **Key Points**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Redo is still **physical** (simpler and efficient).\n",
    "  * Undo for early lock release cases is **logical**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.6 Logging Structure with Logical Undo**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For an operation in transaction **Ti**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Operation Begin**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Log: `(Ti, Oj, Operation Begin)`\n",
    "\n",
    "       * `Oj` = Operation ID.\n",
    "  2. **Physical Update Log Records**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Store **old value** (for physical undo if needed before op completes).\n",
    "     * Store **new value** (for physical redo).\n",
    "  3. **Operation End**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Log: `(Ti, Oj, Operation End, Logical Undo Info)`\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Logical undo info: Counter-operation (e.g., delete for insert).\n",
    "* **Crash Cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Before Operation Ends**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use physical undo.\n",
    "  * **After Operation Ends**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use logical undo (ignore physical undo info).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.7 Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "* T1 inserts `(K5, RID7)` into index `I9`:\n",

    "  * **Operation Begin**: `(T1, O1, Begin)`\n",
    "  * **Physical Updates**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Change `X: 10 → K5`\n",
    "    * Change `Y: 45 → RID7`\n",
    "  * **Operation End**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Logical Undo: `Delete from I9 key=K5, RID=RID7`\n",

    "### **1.8 Rollback with Logical Undo**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Scan log backwards.\n",
    "  2. If an **Operation End** with undo info is found:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Perform **logical undo**.\n",
    "     * Log rollback action (like normal operation).\n",
    "     * End rollback with **Operation Abort**.\n",
    "  3. Skip all earlier records for that operation until **Operation Begin**.\n",
    "  4. If **Operation Abort** is found during scan:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Skip to corresponding **Operation Begin**.\n",
    "  5. At **Transaction Start**, log **Transaction Abort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.9 Rollback Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "* T0 updates C: `700 → 600` (O1, undo = C+100)\n",
    "* T1 updates C: `600 → 400` (O2, undo = C+200)\n",
    "* T0 aborts:\n",
    "\n",

    "  * B (unrelated var) undone physically.\n",
    "  * Log: Operation Abort for O1, T0 Abort.\n",
    "* Final:\n",

    "  * T1 commits with C = 500 (effect of its update remains).\n",

    "### **2.1 Key Factors to Consider**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importance of Data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Critical data needs more frequent backups.\n",
    "   * Non-critical data can have less frequent backups.\n",
    "2. **Frequency of Change**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Highly volatile data → frequent/daily backups (e.g., transaction logs).\n",
    "   * Static data → occasional backups (e.g., account holder info).\n",
    "3. **Speed of Recovery Needed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Is downtime acceptable?\n",
    "   * Faster recovery requires more resources and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Cost Factors**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hardware/Software**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Backup servers, storage media, automated backup systems.\n",
    "* **Staff**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Skilled personnel for quick recovery operations.\n",
    "  * Higher staff costs for high-speed recovery capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Storage Decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **On-site** vs **Off-site**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On-site: Quick recovery, but vulnerable to site disasters.\n",
    "  * Off-site: Safer from local disasters, slower to restore.\n",
    "* **Multiple Copies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Improves reliability, but increases cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4 Strategy Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not all data needs the same backup frequency or method.\n",
    "* Balance between **cost**, **speed**, and **data criticality**.\n",
    "* Backup/recovery planning is usually a **senior-level decision**, but DB engineers must understand the reasoning.\n",
