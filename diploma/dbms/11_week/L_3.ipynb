    "## **1. Transactional Logging with Hot Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Backup** is essential to preserve:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Correctness** of data\n",
    "  * **Consistency** of the database\n",
    "* Failures can occur due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * System failures\n",
    "  * Power outages\n",
    "  * Disk crashes\n",
    "  * Other unexpected events\n",
    "* Goal: Maintain **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, and **Durability** (ACD of ACID).\n",
    "* Recovery methods use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Volatile storage** (RAM – lost on crash)\n",
    "  * **Non-volatile storage** (HDD/SSD – survives crash)\n",
    "  * **Stable storage** (Highly reliable media)\n",

    "### **1.2 Cold Backup vs Hot Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cold Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Taken **when database is not processing transactions**.\n",
    "* Can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Full** backup\n",
    "  * **Differential** backup\n",
    "  * **Incremental** backup\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hot Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Taken **while the database is running and processing transactions**.\n",
    "* Essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Banking systems\n",
    "  * Stock exchanges\n",
    "  * Asset management\n",
    "  * Real-time apps\n",
    "* Typically uses **transaction logs** rather than full data backup (to reduce cost & size).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Why Use Transaction Logs for Hot Backup?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Direct hot backup of **entire database files (e.g., B+ trees)** is expensive & impractical.\n",
    "* Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Keep **cold backup** for large data files.\n",
    "  * Keep **hot backup** for **transaction logs**.\n",
    "* On failure:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Restore from **last cold backup**.\n",
    "  2. Use hot backup (transaction log) to bring DB to state just before crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.4 Transaction Log Usage Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a write request comes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First**, write the change to the **transaction log** (stored in hot backup medium like NVRAM).\n",
    "2. **Then**, apply the change to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If crash occurs before writing to database, the log still has the change.\n",
    "* During recovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Restore cold backup.\n",
    "  2. Replay logs to reapply lost changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.5 Recovery vs Restore**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recover**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Load the latest cold backup (data files + transaction logs) into the system.\n",
    "* **Restore**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Replay transaction logs to bring DB to a consistent state after recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Crash occurs mid-backup.\n",
    "2. **Recover**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load cold backup from disk/tape.\n",
    "3. **Restore**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Replay logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Apply any committed updates missing in data.\n",
    "     * Ensure changes reflect intended final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vendors often replay **entire transaction log** instead of selectively applying changes—simpler and safer.\n",

    "## **2. Recovery in Concurrent Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 From Serial to Concurrent Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously: Recovery was discussed for **serial** transactions.\n",
    "Now: Extend to **concurrent** transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Assumption for Concurrent Recovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If transaction **Ti** modifies item **A**, **no other transaction** can modify **A** until Ti:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Commits** or\n",
    "  * **Aborts**\n",
    "* Reason: Allows clean rollback without conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Buffer Management Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Serial Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Persistent storage (disk) → Main memory buffer.\n",
    "* Transactions work on **private buffers** separate from main memory buffer.\n",
    "* **Input** = Read from disk to buffer.\n",
    "* **Output** = Write from buffer to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concurrent Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disk → Shared memory buffer (may contain data from multiple transactions).\n",
    "* **Each transaction** has:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Its own **private work area** in memory.\n",
    "  * Prevents other transactions from seeing intermediate changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4 Logging Format in Normal Operation**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each transaction **Ti**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ti start**\n",
    "2. For each update:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Record: **(Ti, Xj, old\\_value, new\\_value)**\n",
    "3. On commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Record: **Ti commit**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.5 Rollback During Normal Operation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a transaction rolls back (e.g., deadlock):\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Scan log **backwards** from last entry.\n",
    "  2. For each update record:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Undo**: Write old\\_value back.\n",
    "     * Record a **Compensation Log Record (CLR)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "       * Format: `(Ti, Xj, new_value → old_value, CLR)`\n",
    "  3. On reaching **Ti start**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Record **Ti abort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Checkpointing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: Limit the amount of log replay needed during recovery.\n",
    "* **Checkpoint**: Moment when all modified data in memory is written to disk and a checkpoint record is added to the log.\n",
    "* Types of transactions w\\.r.t checkpoint & crash:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Committed before checkpoint** → No action needed.\n",
    "  2. **Started before checkpoint, committed after checkpoint** → Redo.\n",
    "  3. **Started after checkpoint, committed before crash** → Redo.\n",
    "  4. **Started before crash but not committed** → Undo.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Redo-Undo Recovery Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 Why Redo Before Undo?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even incomplete transactions’ changes must be **redone** first, so their effects can then be **undone** cleanly.\n",
    "* Prevents inconsistencies from partial writes lost due to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Redo Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find last checkpoint.\n",
    "2. Initialize **Undo List** = Transactions active at checkpoint.\n",
    "3. Scan forward from checkpoint:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If **update log record**: Apply redo.\n",
    "   * If **start**: Add to Undo List.\n",
    "   * If **commit/abort**: Remove from Undo List.\n",
    "4. End result:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Database matches state at crash time.\n",
    "   * Undo List = incomplete transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.3 Undo Phase**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scan log backwards.\n",
    "2. For each update in Undo List transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Apply **old\\_value**.\n",
    "   * Write **CLR**.\n",
    "3. On **Ti start**: Write **Ti abort** and remove from Undo List.\n",
    "4. Stop when Undo List is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.4 Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **T0 start**, update B (2000→2050)\n",
    "* **T1 start**, checkpoint → Undo List = {T0, T1}\n",
    "* **T1** updates C2 (700→600), commits (remove from Undo List)\n",
    "* **T2 start**, update A\n",
    "* **T0 rollback** (normal), write CLR for B, T0 abort\n",
    "* Crash → Undo List = {T2}\n",
    "\n",
    "Recovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Redo Phase**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Replay T2’s updates (even though incomplete).\n",
    "2. **Undo Phase**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Undo T2’s changes, write CLR, write T2 abort.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Key Points & Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always **write to log before database** (Write-Ahead Logging – WAL rule).\n",
    "* Maintain **hot backup** of transaction logs.\n",
    "* Use **checkpoints** to shorten recovery time.\n",
    "* In **redo-undo** strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Redo **all** transactions (committed, aborted, incomplete) from checkpoint to crash.\n",
    "  * Undo only **incomplete** transactions.\n",
    "* Replay **entire transaction log** after cold backup for safety."
