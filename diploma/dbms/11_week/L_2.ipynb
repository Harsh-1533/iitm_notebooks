    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the previous module, **backup requirements** and strategies (cold/hot backups, schedules) were discussed.\n",
    "* Cold backup is relatively straightforward, but **hot backup** of transaction logs is essential to recover from failures **at any point** and maintain **database consistency**.\n",
    "* This module focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Possible sources of failure** for transactions.\n",
    "  2. **Recovery strategies** to maintain **Atomicity, Consistency, Durability** (ACD of ACID).\n",
    "  3. **Log-based recovery** methods.\n",
    "  4. Considering **only a single transaction at a time** (serial case).\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Concurrent transaction case is covered in the next module.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Failure Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ACID Review**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Atomicity** → “All or nothing” – transaction should be fully done or not at all.\n",
    "* **Consistency** → Preserve database integrity rules.\n",
    "* **Isolation** → Concurrent transactions behave as if they run sequentially.\n",
    "* **Durability** → Changes survive failures once transaction commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contribution of components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concurrency control** → Ensures isolation → helps maintain consistency.\n",
    "* **Application program** → Must ensure logical correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * E.g., faulty logic: Debit ₹50 from Account A but credit only ₹40 to B → No recovery strategy can fix this.\n",
    "* **Recovery subsystem** → Ensures atomicity & durability → helps consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Failures**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transaction Failures**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Logical errors**: E.g., application code error, invalid input.\n",
    "   * **System errors**: E.g., transaction aborted due to deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **System Crash**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Cause: Power failure, OS crash.\n",
    "   * **Fail-stop assumption**: Non-volatile storage (disk) contents are assumed **not corrupted** by a crash.\n",
    "   * Disks are designed with safeguards.\n",
    "   * But **disk hardware failure** can still happen (e.g., head crash).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Disk Failure**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Head crash** or other hardware issue destroying all/part of disk storage.\n",
    "   * Usually detectable via **checksums** (hash values to verify block integrity).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Recovery Strategy – Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a failure occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scenario**: Transaction updates only part of the data before failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: Transfer ₹50 from A to B.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If only A is debited before crash → inconsistent state.\n",
    "* **Commit delay issue**: Physical writing to disk takes time; failure may occur between logical commit and actual disk update.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Phases in Recovery Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **During normal processing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Record enough information (in logs) to allow recovery later.\n",
    "2. **During recovery**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use recorded info to restore database to a consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Maintain **Atomicity, Consistency, Durability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Types of Storage in Recovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Volatile Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Loses content on crash.\n",
    "   * Examples: Main memory (RAM), CPU cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-volatile Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Survives system crash.\n",
    "   * Examples: Disk, SSD, magnetic tapes, battery-backed RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stable Storage** (Idealized concept)\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Survives **all failures** (system crash, disk crash, disasters).\n",
    "   * Implemented by **multiple copies** on distinct non-volatile media (possibly at remote sites).\n",
    "   * **Challenges**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Synchronizing multiple copies.\n",
    "     * Detecting faulty copies.\n",
    "     * Higher latency for remote updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output Operations with Multiple Copies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: Two copies of each block.\n",
    "* **Write process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Write to first copy.\n",
    "  2. If successful, write to second copy.\n",
    "  3. Output completes only after second write succeeds.\n",
    "* Failures cause **inconsistent copies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detecting inconsistencies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comparing all copies (expensive).\n",
    "* Better: Maintain a record of **in-progress writes** in **non-volatile memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Helps identify which blocks need recovery.\n",
    "  * Common in RAID systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Stable Storage Recovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "When inconsistent blocks are detected:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If one copy fails checksum → overwrite it from the good copy.\n",
    "2. If both copies valid but differ → choose one (e.g., overwrite second with first).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Data Access Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Physical blocks** (on disk) ↔ **System buffer blocks** (in main memory).\n",
    "* **Transactions** operate on **private local buffers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Read X** → Copy from system buffer to transaction’s local buffer.\n",
    "  * **Write X** → Copy from local buffer to system buffer.\n",
    "* **Output Bx** → Write system buffer block back to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Log-Based Recovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Log file** records every change to database items.\n",
    "* Used to **undo** or **redo** actions during recovery.\n",
    "* **Log record format**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  <Transaction ID, Data Item, Old Value, New Value>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **Transaction start record**: `<Ti start>`\n",
    "* **Transaction commit record**: `<Ti commit>`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Immediate vs Deferred Modification**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immediate Modification**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Changes may be written to disk **before** commit.\n",
    "   * **Requirement**: Log record must be written to stable storage **before** the change is written to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deferred Modification**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * No changes are written until commit.\n",
    "   * Simpler recovery, but needs more local storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This module focuses on** **Immediate Modification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Commit Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A transaction is committed when:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Its **commit log record** is written to stable storage.\n",
    "  2. All its previous log records have been output.\n",
    "* Actual data writes to disk may occur **before or after commit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Log**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<T0 start>\n",
    "<T0, A, 1000, 950>\n",
    "<T0, B, 2000, 2050>\n",
    "<T0 commit>\n",
    "<T1 start>\n",
    "<T1, C, 700, 600>\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Writes to disk can happen before or after commit due to logging flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Undo & Redo Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Undo**: Restore old value from log (`old_value → X`).\n",
    "* **Redo**: Reapply new value from log (`new_value → X`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **During rollback**: Only **undo** is needed.\n",
    "* **During crash recovery**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Undo** incomplete transactions.\n",
    "  * **Redo** committed transactions whose updates may not be on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Rules for Failure Recovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `<Ti start>` exists but **no** `<Ti commit>` / `<Ti abort>` → **Undo**.\n",
    "* If `<Ti start>` and `<Ti commit>` exist → **Redo**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Checkpoints**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Periodic points where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Stop all updates.\n",
    "  2. Flush log buffer to stable storage.\n",
    "  3. Write all modified data blocks to disk.\n",
    "  4. Write `<checkpoint>` record (with list of active transactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recovery need not scan the entire log → start from last checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Checkpoint Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Failure occurs after checkpoint.\n",
    "* **Ignore** transactions committed before checkpoint.\n",
    "* Redo committed transactions after checkpoint.\n",
    "* Undo transactions active at failure time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-off**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Frequent checkpoints → faster recovery, but lower throughput.\n",
    "* Infrequent checkpoints → higher recovery cost, but better runtime performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sources of failure**: Transaction, System, Disk failures.\n",
    "* **Storage types**: Volatile, Non-volatile, Stable (via replication).\n",
    "* **Recovery strategy**: Record during execution, recover after failure.\n",
    "* **Log-based recovery**: Maintains old/new values for undo/redo.\n",
    "* **Immediate modification**: Allows early writes with proper logging.\n",
    "* **Undo/Redo rules**: Based on commit/abort records.\n",
    "* **Checkpoints**: Limit log scanning during recovery."
