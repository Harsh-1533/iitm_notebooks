    "### **Learning Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the need for backup** – why databases require backups and situations demanding them.\n",
    "2. **Explore various strategies of backup** – full, incremental, and differential backups, their advantages/disadvantages, and selection based on business needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction & Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Previous modules covered **transactions** and their **ACID properties**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, **Durability**\n",
    "* Covered **concurrent transactions** and **serializability issues**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Conflict serializability**: ensured via acyclic precedence graph (polynomial time)\n",
    "  * **View serializability**: NP-complete problem; requires ad-hoc methods\n",
    "* Recovery from failures:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Cascaded** & **cascadeless rollback**\n",
    "* Locking for isolation → throughput improvement but deadlocks possible → detection/prevention/recovery strategies.\n",
    "* Now moving to **Backup & Recovery**:\n",
    "  Ensures database consistency after **failures beyond control**.\n",

    "## **2. Need for Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "Backup: **Representative copy** of the database containing all necessary data (tables, control files, logs, etc.) to restore in case of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reasons for Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Disaster Recovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Natural disasters, hardware failure, corruption.\n",
    "   * Enables restoring to the latest consistent state.\n",
    "2. **Business Process Changes**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Developers may need older database versions for testing or rollback after changes.\n",
    "3. **Auditing & Compliance**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Financial fraud investigations, legal disputes.\n",
    "   * Need historical snapshots for evidence.\n",
    "4. **Minimizing Downtime**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Without backups, recovery takes much longer.\n",
    "   * Downtime → severe business impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **3. Types of Data to Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Core database content: client info, employee records, sales, course details, rules, etc.\n",
    "2. **System Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Database environment/configurations: system catalogs, log files, software dependencies, disk images.\n",
    "3. **Media Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Large binary objects (BLOBs): images, videos, audio, graphics.\n",
    "   * Usually much larger in size than textual database data.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 Full Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Complete replica of the database at a given point in time (tables, procedures, views, system files, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Take Full Backup:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before any major database operation\n",
    "* Before switching to other backup methods\n",
    "* Frequency depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Application type (e.g., 24/7 banking systems may avoid frequent full backups due to downtime)\n",
    "  * Storage capacity & admin skill availability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple setup and maintenance\n",
    "* Easy recovery (single backup set needed)\n",
    "* Independent backups (loss of one full backup doesn’t affect others)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* High storage requirement\n",
    "* Long downtime during backup\n",
    "* Not always feasible for very large or constantly updated systems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Incremental Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Backs up **only** the data that changed since the **last backup** (full or incremental).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Friday: Full backup\n",
    "* Saturday: Incremental (changes since Friday)\n",
    "* Sunday: Incremental (changes since Saturday)\n",
    "* Monday: Incremental (changes since Sunday), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimal storage usage\n",
    "* Short backup time\n",
    "* Cost-efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recovery requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The last full backup **plus** all subsequent incremental backups\n",
    "* Failure/loss of one incremental backup → incomplete recovery\n",
    "* Slower recovery compared to full backups\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.3 Differential Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Backs up all changes made **since the last full backup**, regardless of intermediate incrementals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Friday: Full backup\n",
    "* Saturday: Incremental\n",
    "* Sunday: Incremental\n",
    "* Monday: Incremental\n",
    "* Tuesday: Differential (since Friday)\n",
    "* Wednesday: Incremental (since Tuesday differential)\n",
    "* Thursday: Incremental, then Friday: Full backup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fewer backup sets needed for recovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Full backup + latest differential + recent incrementals\n",
    "* Faster recovery than pure incremental approach\n",
    "* Suitable when full backups are infrequent (e.g., monthly)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Larger storage than incremental backups\n",
    "* Size of differential may grow close to a full backup if changes are large\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Choosing a Backup Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Granularity trade-off:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Full Backup** → Lowest granularity, simplest recovery, high cost\n",
    "  * **Incremental Backup** → Highest granularity, low cost, complex recovery\n",
    "  * **Differential Backup** → Middle ground, balance between cost & recovery complexity\n",
    "* Business requirements, storage limits, and acceptable downtime influence the choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Case Study: Monthly Backup Schedule**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heavier backups on Sundays (low business activity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Pattern:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Sunday** → Full backup\n",
    "2. **Subsequent Sundays** → Differential backup\n",
    "3. **Weekdays** → Incremental backups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recovery Requirement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 full backup + 1 differential backup + ≤6 incremental backups\n",
    "* Compared to **full + daily incrementals** (31 backup sets in a month), this reduces recovery effort and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Cold Backup vs. Hot Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cold Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Taken when the database is offline or in minimal use.\n",
    "* All earlier strategies (full/incremental/differential) generally describe cold backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hot Backup**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Taken while the database is online and accessible to users.\n",
    "* Essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Real-time, 24/7 systems (e.g., stock markets, online banking)\n",
    "  * Systems with highly dynamic data\n",
    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Continuous availability\n",
    "  * Easier point-in-time recovery\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Complex setup\n",
    "  * Less fault-tolerant; an error can terminate backup\n",
    "  * High maintenance and cost\n",
    "  * Difficult for huge, monolithic datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Transaction Log Backup (for Hot Backup)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transaction Logging:**\n",
    "  Records each database operation (read, write, commit, abort) sequentially.\n",
    "* Transaction logs are **much smaller** than the entire database.\n",
    "* Used for **point-in-time recovery**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Combine a backup (full/differential) with logs to restore up to a specific moment.\n",
    "* Old logs can be discarded once synchronized with the main database.\n",
