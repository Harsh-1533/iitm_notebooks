    "# **DBMS – Backup & Recovery / 5: Backup / 2: RAID**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Learning Outcome**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand **RAID** (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) — its purpose, techniques, and various RAID levels.\n",
    "* Learn how RAID enhances **speed, reliability, and capacity** for database systems.\n",
    "* Understand **trade-offs** between performance, cost, and fault tolerance.\n",

    "## **1. Introduction to RAID**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RAID** stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Redundant Array of Independent Disks** (current terminology)\n",
    "  * Originally: **Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks**\n",
    "* Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Organize **multiple disks in parallel** but **present as a single disk** to the CPU/system.\n",
    "* Advantages of using multiple disks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **High Capacity** – Can store larger volumes of data.\n",
    "  2. **High Speed** – Parallel access increases throughput.\n",
    "  3. **High Reliability** – Redundancy allows data recovery on disk failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Why RAID is Needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probability of at least one disk failing increases with more disks.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * System with **100 disks**, each with MTTF = 100,000 hours (\\~11 years)\n",
    "  * MTTF of system (any disk failure) ≈ (100,000 hours) / 100 = 1,000 hours (\\~41 days)\n",
    "* RAID **manages failure risk** by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Storing **redundant copies** so recovery is possible even if a disk fails.\n",
    "* **Important**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Logical redundancy in DB design (bad for normalization) ≠ Physical redundancy in RAID (good for fault tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Three Primary RAID Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "RAID levels are built by combining these techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Mirroring (Shadowing)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store **duplicate copies** of data.\n",
    "* **Minimum setup**: 2 physical disks for 1 logical disk.\n",
    "* **Operation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Write** → must be done on both disks.\n",
    "  * **Read** → can be done from either disk (faster reads).\n",
    "* **Fault Tolerance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data loss only if both original and mirror fail before repair.\n",
    "  * Handles single disk failure well (except in catastrophic events like fire).\n",
    "* **Cost**: High storage overhead (50% utilization for 2-disk mirroring).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Striping**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split data across multiple disks to increase **parallelism**.\n",
    "* Granularities:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Bit-level striping**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Distribute bits of each byte across disks.\n",
    "    * High parallel read speed, but high seek time.\n",
    "    * Rarely used now.\n",
    "  * **Byte-level striping**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Distribute bytes across disks in a round-robin manner.\n",
    "    * Improves trade-off between speed and complexity.\n",
    "    * Less common today.\n",
    "  * **Block-level striping** (most common):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Distribute **blocks** across disks.\n",
    "    * Requests for different blocks can be served in parallel.\n",
    "    * Formula: Block *i* → Disk `i mod n + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Parity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add an extra bit/block to detect and correct errors.\n",
    "* **Odd/Even Parity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Maintain total number of 1s as odd/even.\n",
    "  * Detects single-bit errors.\n",
    "* **Error Recovery**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If disk failure location is known, data can be rebuilt using XOR of bits from remaining disks + parity disk.\n",
    "* **Parity can be applied** at bit, byte, or block level.\n",
    "* **Advantage**: Lower storage cost than mirroring.\n",
    "* **Disadvantage**: Write operations are slower (need to update parity).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Technique**: Byte-level striping + 1 dedicated parity disk.\n",

    "  * Low parallel bandwidth.\n",
    "* **Use case**: Large sequential data transfers.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "### **4.7 RAID 6 – Block Striping + Dual Distributed Parity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Technique**: RAID 5 + Second parity block (using Reed-Solomon codes).\n",
    "* **Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Tolerates 2 disk failures.\n",
    "* **Cons**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * More complex parity calculation.\n",
