    "## **DBMS – Transactions: Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple transactions are executed **concurrently** in a database, their operations may interleave. This concurrency can improve throughput but can also cause **consistency problems** if not handled correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transaction**: A sequence of database operations (read, write, computation) executed as a single logical unit of work.\n",
    "* **ACID properties**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **A**tomicity – All or nothing execution.\n",
    "  * **C**onsistency – Database moves from one consistent state to another.\n",
    "  * **I**solation – Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other’s intermediate states.\n",
    "  * **D**urability – Committed changes persist even after system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that **some schedules** preserve these properties and others do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Concurrent Execution and Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concurrency** means multiple transactions operate at the same time, possibly on the same data items.\n",
    "* **Serial Execution**: Transactions are executed one after the other, without interleaving.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Always preserves consistency (assuming each transaction is correct).\n",
    "* **Serializable Schedule**: A concurrent schedule that produces the same result as some serial schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Assumptions for Serializability Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Each transaction is correct**: It preserves database consistency in isolation.\n",
    "* A **serial execution** of correct transactions will preserve consistency.\n",
    "* **Non-serial schedule** is serializable if:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It produces the **same final database state** as some serial schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Types of Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main notions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conflict Serializability** – Based on conflicts between operations.\n",
    "2. **View Serializability** – Based on the idea that transactions \"see\" the same data as in a serial execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we focus on **Conflict Serializability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Conflicts Between Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Ii` from transaction `Ti`\n",
    "* `Ij` from transaction `Tj` (where `i ≠ j`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conflict definition**:\n",
    "There is a **conflict** on a data item **Q** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both access **Q** and\n",
    "* At least one of them **writes** to Q.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Types of Conflicts**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read–Read (R–R)**: No conflict (order does not matter).\n",
    "2. **Read–Write (R–W)**: Conflict (read order matters if one writes).\n",
    "3. **Write–Read (W–R)**: Conflict (write before read changes outcome).\n",
    "4. **Write–Write (W–W)**: Conflict (last write determines final value).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Conflict Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "A schedule **S** is conflict serializable if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* By repeatedly **swapping non-conflicting instructions** in S,\n",
    "  we can transform it into a **serial schedule**.\n",
    "* The swaps must not change the meaning of the schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conflict Equivalence**:\n",
    "Two schedules are conflict equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by a series of swaps of **non-conflicting instructions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Good Schedule (Serializable)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* By carefully swapping non-conflicting operations, all operations from T1 appear before T2 (or vice versa).\n",
    "* Produces same result as a serial schedule → **Conflict Serializable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Bad Schedule (Not Serializable)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Withdraw money from an account (T1) and\n",
    "  Apply interest to all accounts (T2).\n",
    "* If interleaved incorrectly, final balance may be wrong (bank may lose or gain extra money).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Identifying Good and Bad Schedules**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal schedules**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Serial schedules** (e.g., T1 then T2 OR T2 then T1).\n",
    "* Some **interleaved schedules** that are equivalent to one of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad schedules**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interleavings that cause incorrect results,\n",
    "  even if each transaction individually is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Schedules That Are Serializable but NOT Conflict Serializable**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rare cases exist where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A schedule is **view serializable** (produces same result as a serial schedule),\n",
    "* But not **conflict serializable** (no swaps possible without changing meaning).\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "* All operations are writes (no reads), so no transaction uses values from others.\n",
    "* Effect is same as serial execution, but no swaps are possible → Not conflict serializable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Precedence Graph (Serialization Graph)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to check **conflict serializability** systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Construct:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create one **node per transaction**.\n",
    "2. For each conflict between `Ti` and `Tj` on data item Q:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Draw a **directed edge** from `Ti` to `Tj`\n",
    "     if `Ti`’s operation must happen before `Tj`’s operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schedule is **conflict serializable** ⇔ Precedence graph is **acyclic**.\n",
    "* If acyclic → Perform **topological sort** to get equivalent serial order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. Algorithm to Test Conflict Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: Schedule S.\n",
    "**Output**: \"Yes\" if conflict serializable, \"No\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify all conflicting operation pairs between transactions.\n",
    "2. Build precedence graph.\n",
    "3. Check for cycles:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Cycle present** → Not conflict serializable.\n",
    "   * **No cycle** → Conflict serializable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Naive: **O(n²)** for n transactions (usually fine since n is small).\n",
    "* Optimized: **O(n + e)** using graph traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **12. Example – Precedence Graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a schedule:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify conflicts: W1(A) → R2(A) means T1 → T2.\n",
    "* Add all edges according to conflicts.\n",
    "* If resulting graph has no cycles:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example topological order: T3, T1, T2, T4, T5.\n",
    "  * This is the equivalent serial schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **13. Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concurrency control** is crucial to ensure consistency in multi-transaction environments.\n",
    "* **Serializable schedules** are safe; they produce the same result as some serial execution.\n",
    "* **Conflict serializability** checks equivalence by swapping non-conflicting operations.\n",
    "* **Precedence graphs** give a systematic way to test for conflict serializability.\n",
    "* **Conflict serializability ⇒ Serializability**, but not vice versa.\n",
    "* Cyclic precedence graph → Schedule is **not** conflict serializable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Understand**: Conflicts occur if two different transactions access the same data item and at least one writes it.\n",
    "* **Identify**: Not all interleavings are bad; some are serializable.\n",
    "* **Analyze**: Use precedence graphs to test conflict serializability efficiently.\n",
    "* **Remember**: Conflict serializability is a sufficient but not necessary condition for serializability."
