    "## **Learning Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the **concept of a transaction** – “doing a task in a database” and its states.\n",
    "2. Explore **issues in concurrent execution** of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction to Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Context**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We already know **data design**, **physical data organization**, **indexing**, and **hashing**.\n",
    "  * Now we focus on **operations** performed on that data — *transactions*.\n",
    "  * Special attention to **issues in concurrent transactions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**:\n",
    "  A **transaction** is a **unit of program execution** in a DBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Consists of **one or more instructions**.\n",
    "  * Instructions can:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Access** data (Read)\n",
    "    * **Update** data (Write)\n",
    "    * Perform computations in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example Transaction**: *Transfer \\$50 from Account A to Account B*\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Read(A)\n",
    "  A = A - 50\n",
    "  Write(A)\n",
    "  Read(B)\n",
    "  B = B + 50\n",
    "  Write(B)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Simplified assumption: Account A has ≥ \\$50 (no balance check).\n",
    "  * Result: A debited by \\$50, B credited by \\$50.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Challenges in Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Failures** can happen **at any time**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Hardware failure\n",
    "   * Software failure\n",
    "   * System crash\n",
    "   * Power outage\n",
    "2. **Concurrent execution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Multiple transactions accessing the same data at the same time.\n",
    "   * Must be done with certain **restrictions** to ensure correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. ACID Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **fundamental concept** in transaction management — acronym **ACID**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(A) Atomicity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"All or nothing\" execution.\n",
    "* Either:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * All steps in a transaction are executed successfully, **OR**\n",
    "  * None are executed (database remains unchanged).\n",
    "* **Problem Example**: Failure occurs after `Write(A)` but before `Write(B)` in the \\$50 transfer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * \\$50 is deducted from A but not credited to B → Money “vanishes”.\n",
    "* **Solution**: Ensure **no partial changes** are visible in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(C) Consistency**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A transaction must take the database from **one consistent state** to **another consistent state**.\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Before transfer: `A + B = Total`\n",
    "  * After transfer: `A + B` must still equal the same Total.\n",
    "* **Consistency can come from**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Explicit constraints**: Primary key, foreign key, etc.\n",
    "  2. **Implicit business rules**:\n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Sum of all account balances - sum of all loans = cash in hand\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "* **Execution phase**: Temporary inconsistencies may occur, but final state must be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(I) Isolation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple transactions executing at the same time **should not interfere** in a way that produces incorrect results.\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * T1: Transfer \\$50 from A to B.\n",
    "  * T2: Read A & B, print `A + B`.\n",
    "  * If T2 runs **in between** T1’s updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Might read A after debit but B before credit → Prints wrong sum.\n",
    "* **Guarantee**: Concurrent transactions should behave **as if executed serially**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(D) Durability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once a transaction **commits**, its effects are **permanent** — must survive failures.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * After a successful commit of the \\$50 transfer, even if a crash happens, changes must remain in DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **4. States of a Transaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to process states in Operating Systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **State Transition Diagram**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Active**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Transaction has started and is executing instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partially Committed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * All operations executed, but not yet committed to permanent storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Failed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Transaction cannot proceed due to error/failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Aborted**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Transaction rolled back to undo changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Committed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * All operations completed, changes made permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Terminated**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Transaction has finished execution (either via commit or abort).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transitions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Active → Partially Committed**: After last statement executed.\n",
    "* **Partially Committed → Committed**: If no failures, data is written to permanent storage.\n",
    "* **Active/Partially Committed → Failed**: Upon encountering failure.\n",
    "* **Failed → Aborted**: Rollback is performed.\n",
    "* **Aborted → Active**: If restarted.\n",
    "* **Aborted/Committed → Terminated**: Final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Concurrency in Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why concurrency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Increase **CPU and disk utilization**: While one uses CPU, another can perform disk I/O.\n",
    "  2. **Reduce response time**: Short transactions can complete sooner even if a long one is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Schedules**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: Order in which operations from multiple transactions are executed.\n",
    "* **Properties of a valid schedule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Must contain all instructions of all transactions.\n",
    "  2. Order of instructions **within a single transaction** must be preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Example Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **T1**: Transfer \\$50 from A to B.\n",
    "* **T2**: Transfer 10% of A’s balance to B.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Types of Schedules**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Serial Schedule**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transactions run one after the other — no interleaving.\n",
    "* Always preserves consistency.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Schedule 1: T1 then T2.\n",
    "  * Schedule 2: T2 then T1.\n",
    "* Both valid, but final results may differ depending on order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Equivalent Schedules**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two schedules are **equivalent** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * They produce the **same final state** of the database.\n",
    "  * They preserve the same effect as a serial schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Non-Serial but Serializable Schedule**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: **Schedule 3**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Some interleaving occurs.\n",
    "  * Temporary inconsistencies may occur.\n",
    "  * Final state matches some serial schedule → *Serializable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Non-Serializable Schedule**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: **Schedule 4**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Interleaving causes incorrect final state.\n",
    "  * Sum `A + B` changes permanently → violates consistency.\n",
    "  * No serial schedule produces this result → *Not serializable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Transactions are **units of execution** that must follow ACID.\n",
    "* Failures and concurrency require careful management.\n",
    "* **Schedules** determine the correctness of concurrent execution.\n",
    "* Serializable schedules behave like some serial execution — ensures correctness.\n",
    "* Not all concurrent schedules are serializable."
