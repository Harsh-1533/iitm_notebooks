    "# **DBMS – Concurrency Control/1**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Learning Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand why designing serializable schedules in advance is difficult.\n",
    "2. Learn about **Lock-Based Protocols** for concurrency control.\n",
    "3. Understand how **locks** can be implemented and used to ensure **conflict serializability** and **recoverability**.\n",
    "4. Recognize issues such as **deadlock**, **starvation**, and trade-offs between safety and concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before this module:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We studied **serializability** (conflict & view), **recoverability**, and **cascade/cascadeless rollback**.\n",
    "* View serializability is weaker than conflict serializability but checking it is **NP-complete** (expensive to test).\n",
    "* Using only serializability & recoverability checks **after** execution is too late to prevent issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Need for Concurrency Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schedules may still not be **adequately concurrent** even if they’re serializable and recoverable.\n",
    "* We need **runtime mechanisms** to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Allow high concurrency.\n",
    "  * Maintain **ACID** properties.\n",
    "  * Ensure recoverability.\n",
    "* Naive approach: let only **one transaction run at a time** → safe but poor concurrency & throughput.\n",
    "* **Concurrency control schemes** balance:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Concurrency level.\n",
    "  * Overhead in managing locks/checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop **protocols** that ensure serializability **dynamically**.\n",
    "* Must prevent conflicts *before* they happen, instead of detecting them afterward.\n",
    "* **Main approach:** Isolation through **mutual exclusion** on data items → Lock-Based Protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Lock-Based Protocols**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure **mutually exclusive** access to a data item.\n",
    "* Instead of locking the whole database (serial execution), **lock specific data items**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Types of Locks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exclusive Lock (X-lock)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Allows **read + write**.\n",
    "   * Only **one transaction** can hold X-lock on a data item.\n",
    "   * Requested via `lock-X(data_item)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shared Lock (S-lock)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Allows **read only**.\n",
    "   * Multiple transactions can hold S-lock on the same item simultaneously.\n",
    "   * Requested via `lock-S(data_item)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 4.3 Lock Compatibility Matrix\n",

    "| **S-lock**         | Yes        | No         |\n",
    "| **X-lock**         | No         | No         |\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Yes**: Lock can be granted concurrently.\n",
    "* **No**: Lock cannot be granted until the other is released.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Lock Protocol Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transaction requests lock from **Lock Manager**.\n",
    "2. If compatible → lock is granted.\n",
    "3. If not compatible → transaction waits.\n",
    "4. **Hold** the lock as long as you need the data.\n",
    "5. **Unlock** when done (but unlocking too early may cause inconsistency).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Example: Unlocking Too Early Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **T1** transfers \\$50 from B → A.\n",
    "* **T2** prints A + B.\n",
    "\n",
    "If T1:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Locks B → updates → unlocks B (before updating A).\n",
    "* T2 can then read the **new B** but the **old A** → inconsistent sum.\n",
    "* Output may be **250** instead of correct **300**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Delay unlocking B until **after** updating A → prevents T2 from reading inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Deadlock Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadlock example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **T3** holds X-lock on B, needs X-lock on A.\n",
    "* **T4** holds S-lock on A, needs S-lock on B.\n",
    "* Both wait for each other → **deadlock**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resolution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Roll back one transaction → release locks → break cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key point:**\n",
    "Deadlock is **possible in any locking protocol**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **Why Prefer Lock-Based Protocols Despite Deadlocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Without locks → inconsistent states possible → **real-world damage**.\n",
    "* With locks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Risk of deadlocks → can be handled via rollback.\n",
    "  * Inconsistency prevention is worth the trade-off.\n",

    "\n",

    "* **Write**: Acquire X-lock if no other locks exist.\n",

    "  * If only this transaction has S-lock → upgrade to X-lock.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Deadlock** still possible.\n",
    "* **Starvation (Livelock)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A transaction waits too long for a lock.\n",
    "  * Others repeatedly get the lock first.\n",

    "## 11. **Strict & Rigorous 2PL**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Strict 2PL**:\n",

    "  * Hold **all X-locks** until commit/abort.\n",
    "  * Prevents **cascading rollback**.\n",
    "* **Rigorous 2PL**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Hold **all locks** (S and X) until commit/abort.\n",
    "  * Transactions serialized in order of commit.\n",

    "## 12. **Trade-Off**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stricter locking** → safer execution (less rollback) but **less concurrency**.\n",
    "* **Looser locking** → more concurrency but higher risk of cascading rollback/inconsistency.\n",

    "## 14. **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designing serializable schedules ahead of time is impractical → use runtime locking protocols.\n",
    "* Locks provide mutual exclusion → maintain isolation.\n",
    "* Two-phase locking ensures conflict serializability but not deadlock freedom.\n",
