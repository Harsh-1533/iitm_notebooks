    "## **DBMS – Transactions Recoverability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Context:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In previous modules, we studied *concurrent transaction execution* and problems like **lost update**, **temporary update**, **dirty read**, etc.\n",
    "  * **Serializability** ensures that concurrent execution of transactions maintains **isolation** and **consistency**.\n",
    "  * **Conflict Serializability** is a widely used criterion for correctness of concurrent schedules.\n",
    "* **Problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Even with serializability, **atomicity** and **consistency** can be compromised if **system failures** occur (power outage, hardware crash, software crash).\n",
    "* **Goal of this topic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Understand **Recoverability** – the ability to restore the database to a **consistent state** after a failure.\n",
    "  * Explore **View Serializability** – a weaker form of serializability that allows more concurrent schedules compared to conflict serializability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Recovery Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 What is the Recovery Problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Suppose a serial transaction transfers ₹50 from account A to account B.\n",
    "  * If the system fails after A is updated but before `COMMIT`, the database will have inconsistent data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * A’s value decreased.\n",
    "    * B’s value not yet increased.\n",
    "* **Need:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Changes made by a failed transaction **must be undone** → rollback to previous consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Recoverability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A schedule is **recoverable** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For any two transactions **Ti** and **Tj**,\n",
    "> If **Tj** reads a data item **Q** written by **Ti**,\n",
    "> then **Ti** must commit **before** **Tj** commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Why Recoverability?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If **Ti** aborts after **Tj** has read its uncommitted value, then **Tj** must also abort → prevents inconsistent database state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Example – Non-Recoverable Schedule**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **T8** writes A → **T9** reads A → **T9 commits** → **T8 aborts**\n",
    "* Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * T9 committed with incorrect (uncommitted) data from T8.\n",
    "  * Database is now **inconsistent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Cascading Rollback**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 What is Cascading Rollback?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When one transaction aborts, all other transactions that read its intermediate results must also be rolled back.\n",
    "* This can cause a **chain reaction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * T10 writes A → T11 reads A → T12 reads data from T11.\n",
    "  * If T10 aborts → T11 aborts → T12 aborts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cascading rollback can be long and **costly** in terms of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Cascadeless Schedules**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.1 Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A schedule is **cascadeless** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For every pair of transactions **Ti** and **Tj**,\n",
    "> If **Tj** reads a data item previously written by **Ti**,\n",
    "> then **Ti** must commit **before** **Tj** reads it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5.2 Benefit**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Eliminates cascading rollback.\n",
    "* Improves performance.\n",
    "* Still guarantees recoverability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Examples of Recoverability and Cascadelessness**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Recoverable:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * T2 commits before T1 commits.\n",
    "   * If T1 fails, rollback is impossible.\n",
    "2. **Recoverable but with Cascading Rollback:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * T2 commits after T1 commits → rollback possible.\n",
    "   * If T1 fails, T2 must also rollback.\n",
    "3. **Cascadeless:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * T2 reads from T1 only after T1 commits → no cascading rollback.\n",

    "## **7. SQL Transaction Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.1 Transaction Control Language (TCL) Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **COMMIT** – Saves changes permanently.\n",
    "2. **ROLLBACK** – Undoes changes to the start of transaction or a savepoint.\n",
    "3. **SAVEPOINT** – Marks a point to which a rollback can occur.\n",
    "4. **SET TRANSACTION** – Sets properties (e.g., `READ ONLY`, `READ WRITE`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.2 Important Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* TCL commands apply to **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE** only.\n",
    "* DDL operations (`CREATE`, `DROP`) auto-commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.3 Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **COMMIT Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  DELETE FROM students WHERE age = 25;\n",
    "  COMMIT;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **ROLLBACK Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * After deletion, if `ROLLBACK` is executed, deleted rows are restored.\n",
    "* **SAVEPOINT Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SAVEPOINT sp1;\n",
    "  DELETE FROM table WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "  SAVEPOINT sp2;\n",
    "  DELETE FROM table WHERE id = 2;\n",
    "  ROLLBACK TO sp2; -- Undoes delete of id=2 but keeps delete of id=1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **RELEASE SAVEPOINT:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Removes a savepoint from the transaction.\n",

    "## **8. View Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8.1 Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Conflict Serializability** is strict but excludes many safe concurrent schedules.\n",
    "* **View Serializability** is weaker → allows more schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8.2 Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two schedules **S** and **S′** are **view equivalent** if they satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Read Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If a transaction reads the **initial value** of an item in S, it must also read the initial value in S′.\n",
    "2. **Read-Write Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If Ti reads a value of Q produced by Tj in S, then Ti must read the value of Q produced by Tj in S′.\n",
    "3. **Final Write Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The transaction that performs the **final write** on Q in S must also do so in S′.\n",
    "\n",
    "A schedule is **view serializable** if it is view equivalent to a **serial schedule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8.3 Relation to Conflict Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* All conflict-serializable schedules are also view-serializable.\n",
    "* View-serializable schedules that are **not** conflict-serializable have **blind writes** (write without reading).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8.4 Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Testing** for view serializability is **NP-complete**.\n",
    "* Precedence graph (easy for conflict serializability) doesn’t work directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. Example – Checking View Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Given Schedule Analysis Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. List possible serial schedules (n! for n transactions).\n",
    "2. Apply **Final Write Condition** to eliminate schedules.\n",
    "3. Apply **Initial Read Condition** to further reduce.\n",
    "4. Apply **Read-Write Condition**.\n",
    "5. Remaining schedule(s) = equivalent serial schedule(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **10. Beyond View Serializability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some schedules are **not** conflict-serializable or view-serializable, yet produce the **same final result** as some serial execution.\n",
    "* Detecting such cases requires analyzing **actual operations and data values** → more complex, not covered in standard serializability tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **11. Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recoverability** ensures no transaction commits based on uncommitted data.\n",
    "* **Cascadeless schedules** improve performance and simplify recovery.\n",
    "* **TCL in SQL** allows control over transaction boundaries and rollback points.\n",
    "* **View Serializability** is a more permissive alternative to conflict serializability, but harder to test.\n",
    "* **Blind writes** are the reason some non-conflict-serializable schedules can still be view-serializable.\n",
    "* Some schedules are serializable in practice but undetectable by read-write based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Learning Outcomes Achieved:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understood what happens if system fails mid-transaction.\n",
    "* Learned **Recoverability** rules and cascade issues.\n",
    "* Covered **Conflict vs View Serializability** and why view serializability is needed.\n",
    "* Applied **SQL transaction control** for recovery management."
