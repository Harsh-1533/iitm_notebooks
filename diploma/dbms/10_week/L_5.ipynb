    "## **1. Deadlock in Database Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **deadlock** occurs when a set of transactions are each **waiting for another transaction in the set** to release a lock, resulting in **no progress**.\n",
    "* The simplest case: 2 transactions wait on each other.\n",
    "* Can also occur with multiple transactions in a circular wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "* T1 waits for a data item locked by T2\n",
    "* T2 waits for a data item locked by T1\n",
    "* Neither can proceed → deadlock.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **2. Deadlock Prevention**\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: Ensure the system **never enters a deadlock state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-locking all data items** before starting a transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Requires a transaction to lock *all* needed items before it begins.\n",
    "   * Impractical for large numbers of items → **reduces concurrency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partial ordering of data items**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Impose a fixed ordering of locks.\n",
    "   * Transactions can request locks only in this order.\n",
    "   * Prevents cycles in the wait-for graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Timestamp-based prevention schemes**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use **timestamps** to determine which transactions wait and which are aborted.\n",
    "   * Timestamp = unique identifier for transaction order (based on start time, not necessarily real clock time).\n",

    "## **3. Timestamp-Based Deadlock Prevention Schemes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Timestamp Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TS(Ti)` = timestamp of transaction `Ti`.\n",
    "* Smaller `TS` → older transaction.\n",
    "* Two main schemes:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Non-Preemptive: Wait-Die Scheme**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Older transactions** may **wait** for younger ones.\n",
    "* **Younger transactions** requesting a lock held by older transactions are **aborted** (killed) immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "If `TS(Tn) < TS(Tk)` → **Tn waits**.\n",
    "If `TS(Tn) > TS(Tk)` → **Tn is aborted** and restarted **with the same timestamp** after a random delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Die” = younger transaction killed.\n",
    "* Avoids deadlock.\n",
    "* Restart with same timestamp to avoid *becoming even younger* each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Preemptive: Wound-Wait Scheme**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Older transactions** preempt (wound) younger ones.\n",
    "* **Younger transactions** may wait for older ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "If `TS(Tn) < TS(Tk)` → **Tn kills Tk** (preemption).\n",
    "If `TS(Tn) > TS(Tk)` → **Tn waits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Older person enters the room → younger gives up the chair.\n",
    "* Younger person enters → waits until older person leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Wound” = older transaction forces younger to abort.\n",
    "* Prevents deadlock, reduces wasted work for older transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Other Prevention Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Timeout-based**: A transaction waits for a lock only up to a fixed time limit.\n",
    "  If lock not granted → transaction aborts and restarts.\n",
    "* Guarantees no deadlock, but **starvation possible** (a transaction may never get the resource).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Deadlock Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "If prevention is not used, system must detect deadlock dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Wait-For Graph (WFG)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vertices**: Transactions\n",
    "* **Edges**: Ti → Tj means Ti is waiting for a resource held by Tj.\n",
    "* **Detection Rule**: Deadlock exists **iff** WFG contains a **cycle**.\n",
    "* WFG is **continuously updated** as lock requests and releases happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Deadlock Recovery**\n",
    "\n",
    "When deadlock detected:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select a victim transaction** to rollback.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Goal: **minimum cost** (minimize wasted work).\n",
    "   * Cost factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * How much work has been done.\n",
    "     * How many resources held.\n",
    "     * How many rollbacks already suffered (to avoid starvation).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rollback Options**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Total rollback**: abort entire transaction.\n",
    "   * **Partial rollback**: rollback only to a point (lock point) that breaks the deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Starvation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Increase victim cost for transactions that have been rolled back more often.\n",
    "   * Ensures every transaction eventually proceeds.\n",

    "### **For each data item Q:**\n",

    "\n",
    "   * Allow read.\n",
    "   * Update `R-timestamp(Q) = max(R-timestamp(Q), TS(Ti))`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. If `TS(Ti) < R-timestamp(Q)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Ti is older than the latest read of Q → writing would violate serializability → **Abort Ti**.\n",
    "2. If `TS(Ti) < W-timestamp(Q)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Ti is older than the latest write → would write obsolete value → **Abort Ti**.\n",
