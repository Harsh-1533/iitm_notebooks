    "## 🔷 **1. Attribute Set Closure**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **closure of an attribute set X**, denoted **X⁺**, is the set of all attributes that **can be functionally determined** from X using a given set of FDs (F).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To test **if X is a super key**\n",
    "* To test **if X → Y** holds\n",
    "* To identify **candidate keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with X⁺ = X\n",
    "2. Repeat:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If Y → Z and Y ⊆ X⁺, then add Z to X⁺\n",
    "3. Stop when X⁺ doesn't change\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = {A → B, B → C}, find A⁺\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start: A⁺ = {A}\n",
    "* A → B ⇒ A⁺ = {A, B}\n",
    "* B → C ⇒ A⁺ = {A, B, C}\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **A⁺ = {A, B, C}**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔷 **2. Extraneous Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **attribute is extraneous** if **removing it doesn't change** the meaning of the FD set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **In LHS**: e.g., in AB → C, is A or B unnecessary?\n",
    "* **In RHS**: e.g., A → BC, is B or C unnecessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Tests for Extraneous Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LHS Test**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To test if `A` in `AX → Y` is extraneous:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Compute **(X)⁺** without `A`, and check if it still determines Y\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RHS Test**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For `X → AY`, remove A and check if X still determines A using other FDs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = {A → B, B → C, AC → D}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is **C** extraneous in AC → D?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Check if A alone can derive D\n",
    "  * A → B, B → C, but no path to D ⇒ C **not** extraneous\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔷 **3. Equivalence of Sets of Functional Dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Two FD sets F and G are **equivalent** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every FD in F can be derived from G (F ⊆ G⁺)\n",
    "* Every FD in G can be derived from F (G ⊆ F⁺)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔷 **4. Canonical Cover (Minimal Cover)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **canonical cover** is a **minimal equivalent** set of FDs with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No extraneous attributes\n",
    "* No redundant FDs\n",
    "* Each FD is in form: **X → A** (only one attribute on RHS)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Steps to Find Canonical Cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split** FDs so each has **single attribute on RHS**\n",
    "2. **Remove extraneous attributes** from LHS and RHS\n",
    "3. **Remove redundant FDs** one by one\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given F = {A → BC, B → C, A → B}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Split → A → B, A → C, B → C\n",
    "* Step 2: Remove A → C? Already implied via A → B, B → C\n",
    "* Final cover: {A → B, B → C}\n",

    "\n",
    "A decomposition of R into R1 and R2 is **lossless** if:\n",

    "> (R1 ∩ R2) → R1 **or** (R1 ∩ R2) → R2\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔷 **6. Characterizing Dependency Preservation**\n",
    "\n",
    "A decomposition **preserves dependencies** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The union of the closures of the FDs in R1 and R2 implies **all original FDs** in F.\n",

    "## ✅ **Module Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute attribute closures\n",
    "* Detect and eliminate **extraneous attributes**\n",
    "* Identify **equivalent FD sets**\n",
    "* Derive a **canonical cover**\n",
