    "These are rules to derive new FDs from given ones.\n",

    "### ✅ **Basic Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflexivity**: If Y ⊆ X, then X → Y\n",
    "   (e.g., AB → A)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Augmentation**: If X → Y, then XZ → YZ\n",

    "3. **Transitivity**: If X → Y and Y → Z, then X → Z\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Derived Rules:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We compute the **closure of an attribute set X (X⁺)** w\\.r.t. F to know all attributes X can determine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with X⁺ = X\n",
    "2. For each FD Y → Z in F, if Y ⊆ X⁺, then add Z to X⁺\n",
    "3. Repeat until X⁺ doesn't change\n",

    "2. Y is a **prime attribute** (i.e., part of a candidate key)\n",

    "* May **lose dependencies** (harder to enforce integrity)\n",
    "* May **impact performance** (due to joins)\n",
    "* Sometimes **over-normalization** adds complexity\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔷 **How Good is BCNF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It removes **all redundancy caused by FDs**\n",
    "* But:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Doesn’t always **preserve dependencies**\n",

    "\n",
    "* Functional dependencies describe how attributes relate\n",

    "* Armstrong’s Axioms help derive new FDs\n",
    "* Closure helps with key identification and normalization\n",
    "* Decomposition (esp. to BCNF or 3NF) leads to good schema design\n",
    "* **Trade-off**: BCNF gives minimal redundancy, 3NF preserves dependencies better\n",
