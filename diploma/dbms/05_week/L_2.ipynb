    "Let's explore the key concepts from **Relational Database Design / Module 2**, focusing on **Functional Dependencies**, **Super Keys**, and the **Rules of Functional Dependencies**. I'll explain each clearly, with **examples and depth**.\n",

    "## 🔷 1. Functional Dependencies (FDs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **functional dependency** is a constraint between two sets of attributes in a relation. It says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If two tuples (rows) agree on attributes **X**, they must also agree on attributes **Y**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **X → Y**\n",
    "> (X functionally determines Y)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we have a relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "Student(student_id, name, email, department)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If each `student_id` is unique, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **student\\_id → name, email, department**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because knowing a student's ID lets us uniquely determine all their other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "But:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **email → student\\_id** (only if emails are unique)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Why FDs Matter:**\n",
    "\n",
    "They help us:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the structure of data\n",
    "* Decide on normalization\n",
    "* Prevent redundancy and anomalies\n",

    "## 🔷 2. Super Key\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **super key** is a set of one or more attributes that can **uniquely identify a tuple** (row) in a relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "Employee(emp_id, name, email, phone)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Super key examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `{emp_id}`\n",
    "  * `{email}`\n",
    "  * `{emp_id, name}`\n",
    "  * `{email, phone}` (if both together are unique)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any combination of attributes that **guarantees uniqueness** is a super key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **Candidate Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **minimal** super key (i.e., smallest set that can still uniquely identify a row).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `{emp_id}` is a candidate key\n",
    "* `{emp_id, name}` is a **super key**, but **not** minimal ⇒ **not** a candidate key\n",

    "## 🔷 3. Rules of Functional Dependencies (Armstrong’s Axioms)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are **inference rules** that help us derive all valid FDs from a given set.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **A. Reflexivity Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "If **Y** is a subset of **X**, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **X → Y**\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Example: `{emp_id, name} → name`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **B. Augmentation Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "If **X → Y**, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **XZ → YZ** for any Z\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Example: If `emp_id → email`, then `emp_id, phone → email, phone`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 **C. Transitivity Rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "If **X → Y** and **Y → Z**, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **X → Z**\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ Example: If `student_id → email` and `email → department`, then `student_id → department`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Additional Derived Rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "These help in simplifying FD sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Union**: If `X → Y` and `X → Z`, then `X → YZ`\n",
    "* **Decomposition**: If `X → YZ`, then `X → Y` and `X → Z`\n",
    "* **Pseudotransitivity**: If `X → Y` and `YW → Z`, then `XW → Z`\n",
