    "Letâ€™s break down the **module on Relational Database Design** step-by-step, explain the key concepts, and provide examples for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· **Features of Good Relational Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are qualities that a well-designed database should have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflects real-world structure of the problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Your database should model actual business processes or scenarios accurately.\n",
    "   * **Example**: If a company has departments and employees, the database should have separate tables for `Departments` and `Employees`, with relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Can represent all expected data over time**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * It should be flexible and scalable enough to handle evolving data.\n",
    "   * **Example**: A product table should allow new attributes like \"discount\" to be added later.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoids redundant storage of data items**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Prevent storing the same information in multiple places.\n",
    "   * **Example**: Instead of saving a customer's address in every order row, store it in a `Customers` table and reference it via a foreign key in the `Orders` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Provides efficient access to data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Indexing, proper schema design, and optimized queries help here.\n",
    "   * **Example**: Indexing the `email` column in a `Users` table helps speed up login queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Supports maintenance of data integrity over time**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Enforces rules like foreign keys, unique constraints, and validation checks.\n",
    "   * **Example**: A `BookLoans` table should not allow loan entries for non-existent books.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Clean, consistent, and easy to understand**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Table and column names should be clear, and the schema should not be overly complex.\n",
    "   * **Example**: Name your table `Customers` instead of something cryptic like `CUST_TBL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Note: These objectives may sometimes conflict**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For example, denormalizing (adding redundancy) may improve performance but violate data integrity goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¶ **Atomic Domains and First Normal Form (1NF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Atomic Domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each field should hold **atomic (indivisible)** values.\n",
    "* **Bad**: `PhoneNumbers = \"123-4567, 789-0123\"`\n",
    "* **Good**: Separate each number into its own row or column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ First Normal Form (1NF):\n",
    "\n",
    "* A relation is in 1NF if **all attributes contain only atomic values** and **each record is unique**.\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bad Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| StudentID | Name  | Courses       |\n",
    "| --------- | ----- | ------------- |\n",
    "| 1         | Alice | Math, Science |\n",
    "\n",
    "**1NF Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| StudentID | Name  | Course  |\n",
    "| --------- | ----- | ------- |\n",
    "| 1         | Alice | Math    |\n",
    "| 1         | Alice | Science |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¶ **Redundancy and Anomalies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Redundancy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repeating data unnecessarily.\n",
    "* **Example**: Saving a supplierâ€™s name in every product row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Anomalies:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Insertion Anomaly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Canâ€™t insert data due to missing other data.\n",
    "* **Example**: Canâ€™t add a new course if no students are enrolled in it yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Deletion Anomaly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deleting data also removes useful, unrelated data.\n",
    "* **Example**: Deleting the last student in a course removes the course info.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Update Anomaly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inconsistent data after an update due to duplicates.\n",
    "* **Example**: Changing a supplierâ€™s phone number requires updating every product row.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¶ **Decomposition**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Lossy Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When decomposition leads to **loss of information**.\n",
    "* **Bad Example**: Splitting a table incorrectly and not being able to rejoin to get original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Lossless Join Decomposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Break down tables but still be able to **reconstruct original data** via joins.\n",
    "* **Good Practice**: Carefully maintain foreign keys when decomposing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Good relational design avoids redundancy, ensures data integrity, and supports efficient access.\n",
    "* 1NF is the first step in normalization.\n",
    "* Be cautious of anomalies.\n",
    "* Decompose wisely to ensure no data is lost."
