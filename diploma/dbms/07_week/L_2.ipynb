    "### 📌 **1. Application Architecture Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modern applications often follow a **three-tier architecture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Presentation Layer (Frontend)** – User interface (HTML, CSS, JS)\n",
    "  * **Business Logic Layer** – Processes user inputs, applies rules\n",
    "  * **Data Access Layer** – Interacts with databases (SQL/NoSQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 **2. Web Fundamentals**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌍 World Wide Web (WWW)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Distributed information system** based on **hypertext**\n",
    "* Core document format: **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** – a W3C standard\n",
    "* Hypertext: Text with **links** to other documents or sections\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔗 URL (Uniform Resource Locator)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identifies and locates documents globally\n",
    "* Structure of URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  protocol://host/path?query_parameters\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Protocol**: `http`, `https`, `file`, etc.\n",
    "  * **Host**: domain or IP address\n",
    "  * **Path**: file location on the host\n",
    "  * **Query Parameters** (optional): data passed to the server (`?key=value`)\n",

    "### 🧱 **3. HTML Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HTML documents** use **tags** to define elements\n",
    "* Tags are enclosed in angle brackets `<tag>`, closing tag `</tag>`\n",
    "* Example: Table structure\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### ⚙️ HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Connectionless** protocol: no persistent connection between client and server\n",
    "* Each request/response is independent\n",
    "* Suitable for static pages, **but problematic for secure, continuous sessions** like banking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🍪 Cookies and Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cookie**: Small encrypted text file sent by the server to the client to identify a session\n",
    "* Stored in the browser and sent back with each request\n",
    "* Helps **maintain session** without re-authentication\n",
    "* **Session timeout**: Automatically ends after a period of inactivity for security\n",

    "[Client (Browser)] ⇄ HTTP ⇄ [Web Server] ⇄ [Database/File System]\n",
    "                      ↑ HTML                ↑ SQL/file read\n",
    "                      ↓ Response            ↓ Result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web Server receives HTTP request → Processes/queries backend → Sends HTML response\n",
    "* **Frontend**: HTML + CSS + JavaScript\n",
    "* **Backend**: Server-side languages, e.g., Java (Servlets), Python, PHP\n",

    "### 🧑‍💻 **6. Scripting in Web Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✍️ Script:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **small program**, interpreted instead of compiled\n",
    "* Runs **within another application** (browser/server)\n",
    "* Easier to write and execute for small dynamic tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎭 Client-side Scripting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Runs **in the browser**\n",
    "* Handles quick validations, UI interactions (e.g., form validation)\n",
    "* Example: **JavaScript** validation for a form\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function validate() {\n",
    "  let credits = document.getElementById(\"credits\").value;\n",
    "  if (isNaN(credits) || credits <= 0 || credits > 16) {\n",
    "    alert(\"Credits must be a number between 1 and 16\");\n",
    "    return false;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  return true;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔐 Security for Client-side Scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limited access to system\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Cannot read/write local files\n",
    "  * Cannot access external apps\n",
    "* Prevents malicious behavior from embedded scripts\n",

    "### 📦 **8. Servlets**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 Servlet:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **small service** that responds to a request\n",
    "* Multi-threaded: multiple clients can run the same servlet simultaneously\n",
    "* Typically processes input, performs logic, and generates HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧭 Servlet Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Request comes to server\n",
    "2. Servlet processes input\n",
    "3. Queries DB (if needed)\n",
    "4. Generates HTML response\n",
    "5. Sends back to client\n",

    "#### 🗂️ Example Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "String name = request.getParameter(\"name\");\n",
