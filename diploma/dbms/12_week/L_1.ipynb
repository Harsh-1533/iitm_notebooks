    "1. **Understand the overall flow for Query Processing**\n",
    "2. **Define the Measures of Query Cost**\n",

    "## **1. Overview of Query Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Context from Previous Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In earlier modules, we studied **Backup and Recovery**, **Logging**, **Hot Backups**, **Recovery Algorithms**, and **RAID**.\n",
    "* Now shifting focus to **Query Processing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How an SQL query flows through the DBMS.\n",
    "  * Cost measures for query execution.\n",
    "  * Basic algorithms for operations like **selection**, **sorting**, and **join**.\n",
    "  * How these algorithms affect query performance.\n",

    "### **1.2 Query Processing Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Stages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parsing & Translation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * SQL query is parsed (like any programming language).\n",
    "   * Translated into **Relational Algebra (RA)** expressions.\n",
    "   * SQL ↔ Relational Calculus ↔ Relational Algebra equivalence.\n",
    "2. **Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Relational algebra expression may have multiple equivalent forms.\n",
    "   * Not all are equally efficient → choose the one with lowest cost.\n",
    "   * Primary cost measure = **time**; sometimes **space**.\n",
    "   * Uses **statistics from the system catalog** (e.g., tuple counts, index info) to choose an efficient plan.\n",
    "3. **Execution Plan**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Specifies the exact operations (e.g., selection order, join method, index usage).\n",
    "4. **Evaluation Engine**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Executes the plan step-by-step using access methods (e.g., B+ tree index, sequential scan).\n",
    "   * Produces the **query output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "SQL Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT salary \n",
    "FROM instructor\n",
    "WHERE salary < 75000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Option 1:** Selection → Projection.\n",
    "* **Option 2:** Projection (salary only) → Selection.\n",
    "* Both are equivalent RA expressions.\n",
    "* The optimizer chooses the cheaper one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Measures of Query Cost**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Primary Cost Metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total elapsed time** to answer a query.\n",
    "* Depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Disk access time** (dominant factor).\n",
    "  * CPU time (often small).\n",
    "  * Network communication time (ignored here for simplicity).\n",
    "* We **focus on disk access** cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Disk Access Cost Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Seek Time (tS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Time to position the disk head over the desired track.\n",
    "2. **Block Transfer Time (tT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Time to read/write a block after the head is positioned.\n",
    "3. **Write Cost**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Higher than read cost (includes verification step).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Cost Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `B` = Number of blocks transferred.\n",
    "* `S` = Number of seeks.\n",
    "* `tT` = Time to transfer one block.\n",
    "* `tS` = Time to seek one block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Cost**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Cost} = (B \\times tT) + (S \\times tS)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ignore output writing cost (unless explicitly required).\n",
    "* Focus only on **block transfers** & **seeks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4 Buffer Effect**\n",
    "\n",
    "* More **buffer memory** ⇒ fewer disk I/O operations ⇒ lower cost.\n",
    "* Difficult to estimate exactly → use **worst-case estimates** (like algorithm complexity analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Common Relational Operations & Their Costs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case A – Single Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A1**: Linear Search (no index, arbitrary condition)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Cost = 1 seek + `br` block transfers (where `br` = #blocks in file).\n",
    "* **A2**: Linear Search on Equality of Key\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On average, only half the blocks are read.\n",
    "* **A3**: Primary Index on Key\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Cost = `(hi + 1) * (tS + tT)` where `hi` = height of B+ tree.\n",
    "* **A4**: Primary Index on Non-Key\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Read index → multiple matching tuples spread across blocks.\n",
    "* **A5**: Secondary Index on Key\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Similar to **A3** in cost behavior.\n",
    "* **A6**: Secondary Index on Non-Key\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Cost depends on number of matching records `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case B – Conjunctions (`AND`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the **most selective condition** (lowest output size) first.\n",
    "* Apply other conditions in **main memory** on filtered tuples.\n",
    "* If **composite index** exists, use it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case C – Disjunctions (`OR`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If indexes exist for all conditions → use them and take **union** of results.\n",
    "* Otherwise → perform a **linear scan**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Case D – Negation (`NOT`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually requires a **linear scan**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Index-Based Sort**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Read tuples in index order (may cause poor block access pattern).\n",
    "2. **In-Memory Sort**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If data fits in memory → use QuickSort or similar.\n",
    "3. **External Sort-Merge** (most common for large data)\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Phase 1: Create sorted runs of size `m` blocks (fit in memory).\n",
    "   * Phase 2: Merge runs iteratively until one sorted file remains.\n",
    "   * Optimization: If number of runs ≤ available memory blocks, merge in **one pass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Join**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Nested Loop Join**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each tuple in outer relation, scan entire inner relation.\n",
    "* Very costly → `br * bs + br` (br = blocks in outer, bs = blocks in inner).\n",
    "* **Optimization**: Put **smaller relation** as outer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Block Nested Loop Join**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Process blocks instead of tuples → fewer disk I/Os.\n",
    "* Further optimization: Load **M - 2** blocks of outer relation at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Index Nested Loop Join**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use index on join attribute of inner relation.\n",
    "* For each outer tuple, use index to directly fetch matching inner tuples.\n",
    "* Drastically reduces cost for equality/natural joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Duplicate Elimination**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sorting-based**: Sort tuples → adjacent duplicates → remove.\n",
    "* **Hashing-based**: Hash tuples into buckets → remove duplicates in each bucket.\n",
    "* Optimization: Remove duplicates **during merge phase** of external sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.5 Projection**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply projection → eliminate duplicates (same methods as above).\n",
    "* Often performed **together** with duplicate elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.6 Aggregation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Group tuples by aggregation key.\n",
    "* Maintain running aggregates in memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Count**, **Min**, **Max**, **Sum** computed on the fly.\n",
    "  * **Average** computed as `sum / count` after processing all tuples.\n",
