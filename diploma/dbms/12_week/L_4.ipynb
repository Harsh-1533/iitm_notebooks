    "\n",
    "  * **Hierarchical Model** (tree-like, IBM, 1960s).\n",
    "  * **Network Model** (graph-like, early 1970s).\n",

    "  * Reintroduced: **Eric Evans (21st century)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4 Advantages of NoSQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schema-free — no fixed schema required beforehand.\n",
    "* Data replication to multiple sites.\n",
    "* Horizontal scalability (scale-out).\n",
    "* Fault tolerance — no single point of failure.\n",
    "* Low-cost, easy to implement.\n",
    "* High performance for key-value and write-heavy workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.5 Disadvantages of NoSQL**\n",
    "\n",

    "### **3.1 CAP Theorem (Eric Brewer)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Consistency (C)** — all clients see the same data.\n",
    "  2. **Availability (A)** — system always responds to requests (read/write succeed).\n",
    "  3. **Partition Tolerance (P)** — system continues despite network partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule:**\n",
    "Impossible to guarantee all three simultaneously; only **two** can be fully achieved at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "  * **AP** (Availability + Partition Tolerance, sacrifice strong consistency).\n",
    "  * **CP** (Consistency + Partition Tolerance, sacrifice availability).\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Example – Eventual Consistency & Gossip Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data replicated across nodes (M, N, etc.).\n",
    "* When client writes to **N**, other nodes may not see it immediately.\n",
    "* **Gossip Protocol**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Nodes randomly share updates with other nodes over time.\n",
    "  * Eventually, all nodes converge to the latest data if no further updates occur.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.5 CAP Example Classification**\n",
    "\n",
