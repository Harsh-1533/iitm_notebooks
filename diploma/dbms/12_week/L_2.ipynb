    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Query processing and optimization aim to find the **most efficient way** to execute a given query.\n",
    "* The goal is to minimize **query cost**, primarily in terms of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Disk transfers**\n",
    "  * **Disk seeks**\n",
    "* In the previous module:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Discussed selection, sorting, join algorithms, duplicate removal, projection, and aggregation.\n",
    "* In this module:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Focus on **query optimization basics**.\n",
    "  * Learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Transform relational expressions to create equivalent alternatives.\n",
    "    2. Choose the **best cost** query evaluation plan from these alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Query Optimization: Basic Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the query is parsed and translated into a relational algebra expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate equivalent expressions**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Apply transformation (equivalence) rules to create alternatives.\n",
    "2. **Choose algorithms for each operation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * e.g., Which join method to use.\n",
    "3. **Evaluate cost**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Select the best evaluation plan based on estimated cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Representation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Queries are represented as **expression trees** in optimization.\n",
    "* Nodes: relational operators (selection, join, projection, etc.)\n",
    "* Leaves: base relations (tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Example – Moving Selection Down**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retrieve names of instructors and courses they teach in the **Music department**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naive Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Join Teacher and Course.\n",
    "2. Join with Instructor.\n",
    "3. Apply **selection** (`department_name = 'Music'`).\n",
    "4. Apply **projection** (name, title).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimization Idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The selection `department_name = 'Music'` applies **only** to the Instructor relation.\n",
    "* Move the selection **before** the join (push down selection).\n",
    "* Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Reduces the number of tuples early.\n",
    "  * Later joins operate on smaller relations.\n",
    "  * Saves processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Evaluation Plan (Annotated Query Tree)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* An **evaluation plan** = query tree + **specific algorithms** for each operation.\n",
    "* Example: Retrieve instructors in Music dept. teaching in year 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimized Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection on Instructor** (`dept = 'Music'`):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use **index scan** (instructor data is static → indexing efficient).\n",
    "2. **Selection on Teachers** (`year = 2019`):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * No index → use linear scan.\n",
    "3. **Join results** of the above selections using **merge join**.\n",
    "4. **Join with Course** relation using **hash join** (efficient due to unique course IDs).\n",
    "5. **Projection** (name, title) with **duplicate removal** via sorting.\n",

    "---\n",

    "  * Use indexes where possible.\n",
    "* Real optimizer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Must explore **alternatives systematically**.\n",
    "  * Cost estimation based on **statistics** (relation size, index availability, selectivity).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Relational Expression Equivalence**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two relational algebra expressions are **equivalent** if they produce the **same set of tuples** for all **legal database instances**.\n",
    "* Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Tuple **order** does not matter (set semantics).\n",
    "  * For SQL (multiset semantics):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Tuples may be duplicated.\n",
    "    * Equivalence requires **same multiplicity** for each tuple.\n",
    "  * Differences in results for **illegal instances** (violating constraints) are ignored.\n",

    "#### **Selection Distributes over Join**\n",

    "* If condition refers only to attributes from one relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  σθ1 AND θ2 (E1 ⋈θ E2) = (σθ1(E1)) ⋈θ (σθ2(E2))\n",

    "\n",
    "* `(dept = 'Music') AND (year = 2009)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Change join associativity to join smaller intermediate results first.\n",
    "  2. Push each selection to its respective relation (Instructor, Teachers).\n",
    "  3. Reduce size before final join.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3 – Push Projection\n",
    "\n",
