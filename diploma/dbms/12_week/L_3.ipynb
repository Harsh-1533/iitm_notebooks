    "## **6. Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance** in RDBMS is determined by TPS, response time, and availability.\n",
    "* **System architecture** (hardware, network) and **database architecture** (process arrangement, tuning) directly influence performance.\n",
    "* **Scalability** must consider data volume, users, services, and geographic spread.\n",
    "* **Architectural choices** range from centralized → client–server → parallel → distributed systems.\n",
    "* **Scaling options**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Vertical**: Enhance existing hardware.\n",
    "  * **Horizontal**: Add more machines (sharding, replication).\n",
    "* Real-world scalability often limited by startup cost, resource contention, and load imbalance."
