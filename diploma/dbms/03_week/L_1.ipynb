    "## 🗂️ SQL Topics Practiced – In-depth Notes (DBMS)\n",
    "- SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. Below is a breakdown of the SQL topics practiced, with explanations and example queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. SELECT Statement**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Retrieve data from one or more tables.\n",
    "- **Syntax:** \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Cartesian Product / AS**\n",
    "- **Cartesian Product:** When two tables are combined without a condition, every row from the first table is paired with every row from the second.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM TableA, TableB;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **AS (Alias):** Assigns a temporary name to a table or column.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT s.name AS student_name FROM Students AS s;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. WHERE Clause (AND / OR)**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Filter records based on conditions.\n",
    "- **AND:** Both conditions must be true.\n",
    "- **OR:** At least one condition must be true.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE age > 30 AND department = 'HR';\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. String Matching**\n",
    "- **LIKE Operator:** Used for pattern matching with wildcards.\n",
    "    - `%` matches any number of characters.\n",
    "    - `_` matches a single character.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Products WHERE name LIKE 'S%';\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. ORDER BY**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Sort results based on one or more columns.\n",
    "- **Syntax:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Students ORDER BY age DESC;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- **Default:** ASC (ascending).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. IN Operator**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Match values against a list.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE status IN ('Shipped', 'Delivered');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Set Operations**\n",
    "- Combine results from multiple queries.\n",
    "    - **UNION:** Combines results, removes duplicates.\n",
    "    - **INTERSECT:** Returns common rows.\n",
    "    - **EXCEPT:** Returns rows in the first query that are not in the second.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT name FROM Table1\n",
    "    UNION\n",
    "    SELECT name FROM Table2;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Aggregate Functions\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Perform calculations on a set of values.\n",
    "- **Functions:**\n",
    "    - `AVG()` – Average\n",
    "    - `MIN()` – Minimum\n",
    "    - `MAX()` – Maximum\n",
    "    - `COUNT()` – Number of entries\n",
    "    - `SUM()` – Total sum\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees WHERE department = 'IT';\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Summary:\n",
    "- These SQL operations form the foundation of querying and analyzing relational databases in DBMS. Mastery of these enables users to:\n",
    "    - Efficiently retrieve and filter data.\n",
    "    - Combine and compare datasets.\n",
    "    - Generate summarized reports and insights from raw data."
