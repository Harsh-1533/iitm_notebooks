    "\n",
    "### üìå What is a View?\n",
    "A **view** is a **virtual table** based on the result of a `SELECT` query. It doesn‚Äôt store data itself but acts like a window to access data in real tables.\n",

    "## üîç View Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "When a query references a view, the DBMS **expands** the view into its underlying query. \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üóÉÔ∏è Materialized Views\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular views, a **materialized view stores data physically**. It can be refreshed periodically for performance.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dept_avg AS\n",
