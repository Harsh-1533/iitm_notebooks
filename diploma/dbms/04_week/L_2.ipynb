    "You're diving into the heart of **formal query languages** in databases. This topic bridges the gap between **mathematical logic** and **database queries**, and covers **relational algebra**, **tuple relational calculus (TRC)**, and **domain relational calculus (DRC)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s explore each concept deeply and then understand how they relate to each other through **equivalence**.\n",

    "## 🔷 1. **Relational Algebra (RA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Procedural** query language: You tell **how** to get the result.\n",
    "* Based on **set theory** and **algebra**.\n",
    "* Uses operators like `σ` (select), `Π` (project), `∪`, `−`, `×`, `⨝`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focuses on **manipulating relations** using a sequence of operations.\n",
    "* Results are always **relations** (i.e., tables).\n",
    "* Used in query optimization and execution planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find names of students who study Maths:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Π Name (σ Subject = 'Maths'(Students))\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔶 2. **Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-procedural**: You tell **what** you want, not how to get it.\n",
    "* Based on **predicate logic** (first-order logic).\n",
    "* Works with **tuples** (whole rows).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ t | P(t) }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `t` is a tuple variable.\n",
    "* `P(t)` is a **predicate** (logical condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find all students who study Maths:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ t | Students(t) ∧ t.Subject = 'Maths' }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This says: get all tuples `t` from `Students` where `t.Subject = 'Maths'`.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔷 3. **Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also **non-procedural**.\n",
    "* Similar to TRC but works with **domain variables** (individual attributes, not tuples).\n",
    "* Also based on **predicate logic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ <x1, x2, ..., xn> | P(x1, x2, ..., xn) }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each `xi` is a domain variable (e.g., name, age, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find names of students who study Maths:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ <n> | ∃a ∃m ∃s (Students(n, a, m, s) ∧ s = 'Maths') }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This says: return names `n` where there's a tuple with subject `s = 'Maths'`.\n",

    "## 🔍 4. **Predicate Logic Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both TRC and DRC use **predicate logic**, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ➤ **Quantifiers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **∃ (Existential Quantifier)**: \"There exists\"\n",
    "* **∀ (Universal Quantifier)**: \"For all\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"There exists a student named John\":\n",
    "  `∃t (Students(t) ∧ t.Name = 'John')`\n",
