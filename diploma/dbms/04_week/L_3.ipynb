    "## 🌐 **1. Design Process for Database Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is Design?\n",
    "\n",
    "Design in databases refers to creating a structure that accurately represents real-world data and relationships, ensuring data is organized, consistent, and easy to retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 **2. Role of Abstraction in Database Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** helps simplify complex systems by dividing the design into different levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Physical Level**: How data is actually stored.\n",
    "* **Logical Level**: What data is stored and relationships.\n",
    "* **View Level**: How users interact with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🧠 *Example:* A university database stores data about students, courses, and enrollment. Users only see course and student details (view level), but the system stores them in normalized tables (logical level), and files and indexes (physical level).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ **3. Model Building**\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves choosing a **data model** (like ER model, relational model) to represent the real-world data scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 **4. Design Approach → Database Design Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 **Phases of Database Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Requirements Analysis**\n",
    "   – Understand what the system must do (e.g., track students and their courses).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Conceptual Design**\n",
    "   – Use **ER diagrams** to model entities, attributes, and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logical Design**\n",
    "   – Convert ER diagrams into relational schemas (tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Physical Design**\n",
    "   – Define how data is stored (indexes, files, etc.).\n",

    "## 📄 **5. ER Model: Database Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is ER Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a high-level conceptual data model that describes data using:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entities**: Objects (e.g., Student)\n",
    "* **Attributes**: Properties of entities (e.g., Name, Age)\n",
    "* **Relationships**: Associations between entities (e.g., Enrolls)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 **6. Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ▫️ **Simple vs Composite Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple**: Atomic values (e.g., Age = 21)\n",
    "* **Composite**: Can be divided into sub-parts\n",
    "  *Example:* `Name` → First Name, Last Name\n",
    "\n",
    "### ▫️ **Component Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts of composite attributes\n",
    "*E.g.* `Address` → Street, City, Zip\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👤 **7. Entity and Entity Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entity**: A real-world object (e.g., a student named John).\n",
    "* **Entity Set**: A collection of similar entities (e.g., all students).\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Example:* `Student` is an entity set, `John` is an entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 **8. Relationships and Relationship Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relationship**: Association between entities (e.g., John *enrolls* in DBMS)\n",
    "* **Relationship Set**: All such associations (e.g., all student-course pairs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 **Degree of Relationship**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unary** (1 entity set) → e.g., Employee manages Employee\n",
    "* **Binary** (2 sets) → e.g., Student enrolls in Course\n",
    "* **Ternary** (3 sets) → e.g., Doctor treats Patient in Hospital\n",

    "## 🧾 **9. Redundant Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Redundancy refers to storing the same information more than once, which can cause inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: If `Student` entity has `CourseName`, and there is already a relationship to `Course`, that’s redundancy.\n",

    "* Has its own primary key.\n",

    "### 🔹 **Weak Entity Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cannot exist without a related strong entity.\n",
    "* Identified using **partial key** and **total participation** in a relationship.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 **12. Total Participation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If **every instance** of an entity must participate in a relationship, it is **total participation** (double line).\n",
    "* If **some instances** may not participate, it’s **partial** (single line).\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Example:* Every loan **must** be related to a customer → total\n",
