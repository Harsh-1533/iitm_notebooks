    "Great! Let’s go through each concept in your *Entity-Relationship Model/2* module in depth, with explanations and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Entity Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **entity** is a real-world object (like *Student*, *Course*, *Employee*) and an **entity set** is a collection of similar entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "`Student` is an entity set. Each student (John, Aisha, etc.) is an entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Relationship Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **relationship** is an association among entities, and a **relationship set** is a collection of similar relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "`Enrolls` is a relationship set showing which students enrolled in which courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Relationship Sets with Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships can have their own **attributes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "If `Works_On` is a relationship between `Employee` and `Project`, it can have an attribute like `Hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Roles**\n",
    "\n",
    "When an entity set participates more than once in a relationship, we use **roles** to distinguish them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "In a relationship `Manages(Employee, Employee)`, use roles like `Manager` and `Subordinate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Cardinality Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "These define how many entities participate in a relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **One-to-One (1:1)**\n",
    "* **One-to-Many (1\\:N)**\n",
    "* **Many-to-One (N:1)**\n",
    "* **Many-to-Many (M\\:N)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. One to Many & Many to One**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *One-to-Many*: One teacher teaches many courses.\n",
    "* *Many-to-One*: Many students belong to one department.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Total and Partial Participation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total Participation** (double line): Every entity must be in the relationship.\n",
    "* **Partial Participation** (single line): Some may not participate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "All employees must belong to a department (total), but not all departments have interns (partial).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Complex Constraints Notation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for expressing constraints like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keys\n",
    "* Participation (total/partial)\n",
    "* Cardinality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: You might specify that a student must enroll in at least one course.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Complex Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Composite** (e.g., Name → First, Last)\n",
    "* **Multivalued** (e.g., Phone numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Expressing Weak Entity Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak entities don’t have a primary key of their own and rely on another (strong) entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "`Dependent` is weak. It depends on `Employee` and is identified using a **discriminator** (e.g., name of dependent).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. Reduction to Relational Schema**\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating ER models to relational tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Entity sets → tables\n",
    "* Attributes → columns\n",
    "* Relationships → new tables (if M\\:N) or foreign keys (if 1\\:N)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **12. Representing Entity Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entity set becomes a **relation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Entity: `Student(name, roll, age)` → Relation: `Student(name, roll, age)`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **13. Representing Relationship Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on cardinality:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For 1\\:N → Add foreign key to \"N\" side.\n",
    "* For M\\:N → Create new relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **14. Composite Attributes in Schema**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flatten out components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "`Address(Street, City, Pincode)` becomes individual columns in the relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **15. Multivalued Attributes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a separate table for multivalued attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "`PhoneNumbers` table with `(StudentID, PhoneNumber)`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **16. Redundancy in Schema**\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurs when the same data is repeated unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: ER model helps avoid redundancy by using normalized structures and relationships.\n",
