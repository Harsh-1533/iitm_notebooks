    "**Instructor**: Arun Rajkumar\n",
    "**Topic**: Introduction to the **Pillars of Machine Learning**\n",
    "**Goal**: Understand the three mathematical foundations critical for machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear Algebra** (P1)\n",
    "* **Probability** (P2)\n",
    "* **Optimization** (P3)\n",

    "\n",
    "Optimization is one of the three core mathematical tools used to build and understand machine learning (ML) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into optimization, Arun sets the stage with a broader perspective by introducing the **3 Pillars of Machine Learning**:\n",

    "## üß± **Pillars of Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå P1: **Linear Algebra ‚Äì Understanding Structure in Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Helps understand the *relationships* and *structure* within data.\n",
    "* **Example**: Predicting weight based on height (scatter plot in 2D).\n",
    "* **Linear Relationship**: If height increases, weight tends to increase linearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This suggests a **linear model** is suitable.\n",
    "* **Mathematical Tool**: Linear algebra provides the language and tools to work with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations ‚Äî essential for modeling linear relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why Linear?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * It‚Äôs the simplest model to start with.\n",
    "> * Many complex models approximate non-linear relationships using linear transformations (e.g., in neural networks, kernel tricks).\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Intuition Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You plot height (x-axis) vs. weight (y-axis) ‚Üí get a cloud of points.\n",
    "* A line that \"best fits\" these points is your predictive model (regression line).\n",
    "* **But**: Not every point lies perfectly on this line ‚Äî meaning there‚Äôs noise or variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå P2: **Probability ‚Äì Understanding Noise/Uncertainty in Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: To model **uncertainty** and **noise** in real-world data.\n",
    "* **Why Needed?**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data isn‚Äôt perfect.\n",
    "  * Sources of noise include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Measurement error\n",
    "    * Incomplete data\n",
    "    * Random fluctuations\n",
    "* **Mathematical Tool**: Probability helps us reason under uncertainty and quantify it (e.g., probability distributions, expectation, variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example**: Even if there's a linear relationship between height and weight, individual weights may vary due to diet, genetics, etc. ‚Äî probability helps model such variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå P3: **Optimization ‚Äì Making the Best Decision Based on Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: Among many possible models (e.g., many lines), how do we find the **best one**?\n",
    "* **Why Needed?**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Infinite models can \"fit\" the data.\n",
    "  * Need to choose the one that **minimizes error** or **maximizes accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Optimization = Converting Data into Decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once you understand the data structure (Linear Algebra) and uncertainty (Probability), **optimization** helps you:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Make decisions (e.g., choose the best line)\n",
    "  * Minimize error (like Mean Squared Error in linear regression)\n",
    "  * Maximize performance (like accuracy or likelihood)\n",

    "## üìä Full Example: Predicting Weight from Height\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs follow the example given in the lecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You collect data of people‚Äôs height and weight.\n",
    "2. Plot it ‚Üí get scattered points.\n",
    "3. You **hypothesize a linear relationship**: Weight ‚âà a √ó Height + b\n",
    "4. But the data doesn‚Äôt lie exactly on one line ‚Üí there‚Äôs **noise**.\n",
    "5. So, you now want to find the **best fitting line**.\n",
    "6. You define ‚Äúbest‚Äù using a **loss function** (e.g., least squares).\n",
    "7. **Optimization** helps you minimize this loss and find the best parameters *(a, b)*.\n",
