    "\n",
    "### ‚ùì Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimization is used to **convert data into decisions**.\n",
    "* In **supervised learning**, we aim to find the **best classifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: Classify an email as spam or not spam.\n",
    "  * Many classifiers can do this ‚Äî which one is the *best*?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùó Notion of ‚ÄúBest‚Äù:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vague** unless defined precisely.\n",
    "* In ML, \"best\" often translates to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Minimizing loss**\n",
    "  * Or **Maximizing reward**\n",
    "* These goals are formalized using **optimization frameworks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Best classifier = one with **least classification error** (loss).\n",
    "* Best strategy = one with **maximum reward** (in reinforcement learning).\n",

    "## üêÑ Cow-and-Grass Example: A Motivating Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìç Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **cow** is at point **(20, 30)** on a 2D field.\n",
    "* It's tied with a **10-unit rope** (can only move in a circle of radius 10).\n",
    "* A **perpendicular fence** runs vertically through **(25, 0)**, restricting horizontal movement.\n",
    "* **Grass is located at (40, 40)**.\n",
