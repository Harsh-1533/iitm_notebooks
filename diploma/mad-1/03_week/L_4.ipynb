    "## üìå Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Jakob Nielsen, a renowned usability expert, proposed **10 fundamental principles** for designing effective and user-friendly interfaces. These are called \"heuristics\" because they are general rules of thumb rather than specific usability guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Visibility of System Status**\n",
    "- The system should always keep users informed about what is going on.\n",
    "- Provide appropriate feedback within a reasonable time.\n",
    "- Example: A loading spinner or progress bar when uploading a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Match Between System and the Real World**\n",
    "- The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to them.\n",
    "- Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.\n",
    "- Example: Using a trash can icon to delete files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **User Control and Freedom**\n",
    "- Users often choose system functions by mistake and need a clear \"emergency exit\" to leave the unwanted state.\n",
    "- Support undo and redo functions.\n",
    "- Example: An \"Undo\" button after deleting a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Consistency and Standards**\n",
    "- Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.\n",
    "- Follow platform conventions and established patterns.\n",
    "- Example: Standardized button colors‚Äîblue for links, red for delete actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Error Prevention**\n",
    "- Prevent problems before they occur.\n",
    "- Either eliminate error-prone conditions or present users with confirmation options.\n",
    "- Example: A warning pop-up before permanently deleting a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**\n",
    "- Minimize the user‚Äôs memory load.\n",
    "- Make objects, actions, and options visible.\n",
    "- Example: Dropdown menus or autocomplete suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**\n",
    "- Allow both novice and expert users to interact effectively.\n",
    "- Provide accelerators (e.g., shortcuts) to speed up frequent actions.\n",
    "- Example: Keyboard shortcuts for power users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**\n",
    "- Dialogues should not contain irrelevant or rarely needed information.\n",
    "- Every extra unit of information competes with the relevant units and diminishes their relative visibility.\n",
    "- Example: Clean, uncluttered dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**\n",
    "- Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.\n",
    "- Example: ‚ÄúInvalid email format‚Äù instead of a vague ‚ÄúError 400.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Help and Documentation**\n",
    "- Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, help and documentation may be necessary.\n",
    "- Such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, and not too large.\n",
    "- Example: Tooltips, help center links, FAQs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Summary\n",
    "These heuristics are not strict rules but **guiding principles** to create **user-centered designs** that are intuitive, error-resistant, and responsive. Following these leads to improved user satisfaction and interface efficiency.\n",
