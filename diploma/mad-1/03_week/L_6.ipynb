    "# ðŸ“š In-Depth Notes: HTML Generation Using Composable Functions and Templates in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 1. Introduction to Programmatic HTML Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional HTML development requires writing static HTML files. However, **programmatic HTML generation** automates this process using code, allowing dynamic rendering of pages based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Reduces manual HTML coding.\n",
    "- Makes it easy to integrate logic like loops, conditions.\n",
    "- Useful in dynamic web applications, especially those powered by Python backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 2. Composable Functions in HTML Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composable functions** are functions that return HTML components and can be nested or reused to build complex HTML layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### âž¤ Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Composable** means each function can work independently but also integrate with others.\n",
    "- Helps keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "- Encourages modular UI development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… Example Using PyHTML:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyhtml import html, head, title, body, h1, p\n",
    "\n",
    "page = html()(\n",
    "    head()(title(\"My Page\")),\n",
    "    body()(\n",
    "        h1(\"Welcome to my site\"),\n",
    "        p(\"This page was generated using composable Python functions.\")\n",
    "    )\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(page)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 3. Importance of Templates in Web Development\n",
    "- Templates allow the separation of presentation (UI) from logic (backend code), improving clarity and maintainability.\n",
    "## âž¤ Benefits of Templating:\n",
    "- Reuse UI structures (e.g., navigation bar, footer).\n",
    "- Inject data into templates dynamically.\n",
    "- Keep code cleaner in large-scale projects (especially using MVC).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 4. Introduction to Python Templating Libraries\n",
    "- ðŸŸ  PyHTML: Programmatic HTML Generator\n",
    "    - HTML as Python Objects: Write HTML like native Python code.\n",
    "    - Excellent for cases where UI is tightly coupled with data and logic.\n",
    "    - Best for backend rendering or internal tools.\n",
    "- âœ… Features:\n",
    "    - Tag functions: div(), p(), table() etc.\n",
    "    - Nesting elements naturally via parentheses.\n",
    "    - Syntax similar to writing HTML, but in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŸ¢ Jinja2: String-Based Templating Engine\n",
    "- Most popular template engine in Python.\n",
    "- Used by frameworks like Flask, Ansible, Pelican, etc.\n",
    "### âœ… Features:\n",
    "- Supports:\n",
    "    - Loops (for)\n",
    "    - Conditionals (if, elif, else)\n",
    "    - Filters (|length, |lower, |safe, etc.)\n",
    "    - Template Inheritance ({% extends %})\n",
    "    - Macros and custom filters\n",
    "- Syntax similar to Django and Twig (PHP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```jinja2\n",
    "{% if user %}\n",
    "  <h1>Welcome, {{ user }}!</h1>\n",
    "{% else %}\n",
    "  <h1>Please log in</h1>\n",
    "{% endif %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from jinja2 import Template\n",
    "t = Template(\"Hello {{ name }}!\")\n",
    "print(t.render(name=\"Harsh\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 5. When to Use What?\n",

    "| ---------------------------------- | ------ |\n",
    "| HTML generated fully in Python     | PyHTML |\n",
    "| Template files with embedded logic | Jinja2 |\n",
    "| Flask/Django web applications      | Jinja2 |\n",
    "| Small utilities, internal tools    | PyHTML |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 6. Combining Templating with MVC (Model-View-Controller)\n",
    "- Model: Business logic and data.\n",
    "- View: Templates (like Jinja2) render data to the user.\n",
    "- Controller: Accepts input and invokes logic to update the model or render a view.\n",
    "\n",
    "> âž¤ Jinja2 typically acts as the View layer in frameworks like Flask or Django.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”· 7. Bonus: Why Composable Functions and Templates Matter in Real Projects?\n",
    "Scalability: Large sites reuse templates for thousands of pages.\n",
    "Maintainability: One template update reflects across all pages.\n",
    "Collaboration: Frontend and backend teams work independently.\n",
    "Security: Templating engines often auto-escape data to prevent XSS.\n",
