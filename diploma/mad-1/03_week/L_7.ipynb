    "# ðŸ§  Learning Notes: Accessibility in the Context of Web Views\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Learning Outcomes\n",
    "- Understand the concept of **accessibility** in the context of a view and its **importance**.\n",
    "- Learn about the **guidelines given by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**.\n",
    "- Briefly understand the **standards and principles** that are accepted globally for creating an accessible website.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 1. What is Accessibility in Web Development?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accessibility** refers to designing and developing websites and web applications that can be used by **everyone**, including people with **disabilities** such as:\n",
    "- Visual impairments (blindness, low vision, color blindness),\n",
    "- Auditory impairments (deafness),\n",
    "- Motor impairments (difficulty using a mouse or keyboard),\n",
    "- Cognitive impairments (learning disabilities, memory issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to **remove barriers** that prevent access to digital content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 2. Importance of Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inclusivity**: Allows people with disabilities to use the web.\n",
    "- **Legal Compliance**: Many countries enforce accessibility through laws (e.g., ADA, Section 508).\n",
    "- **Better Usability**: Accessible websites improve overall UX for all users (e.g., captions help in noisy environments).\n",
    "- **SEO Benefits**: Search engines favor accessible and well-structured content.\n",
    "- **Business Expansion**: Reaching wider audiences, including elderly users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 3. W3C and Accessibility Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "The **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)** sets global standards for web development, including accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… W3Câ€™s Major Initiative: Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produces guidelines, technical specifications, and support materials.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### ðŸŸ© Core Standard: WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Version: **WCAG 2.2**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 4. WCAG Principles: POUR\n",
    "\n",
    "WCAG is based on four core principles, often abbreviated as **POUR**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Principle  | Description |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Perceivable** | Information and UI must be presentable to all senses (e.g., alt text for images, captions for video). |\n",
    "| **Operable**    | UI must be navigable (e.g., via keyboard, screen readers, no time-based barriers). |\n",
    "| **Understandable** | Content and interface must be easy to comprehend (e.g., clear instructions, error suggestions). |\n",
    "| **Robust** | Content must work with current and future assistive technologies (e.g., proper semantic HTML). |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”· 5. Examples of Accessibility Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "| Technique                        | Why It Helps                                      |\n",
    "|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `alt` attributes for images      | Helps screen readers convey image meaning         |\n",
    "| Proper heading levels (`<h1>`)   | Organizes content structure for screen readers    |\n",
    "| Keyboard navigation support      | Assists users who can't use a mouse               |\n",
    "| High contrast color schemes      | Aids users with visual impairments                |\n",
    "| Labels for form fields           | Ensures clear form input guidance                 |\n",

    "## ðŸ”· 6. Tools to Evaluate Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WAVE**: Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool\n",
    "- **Lighthouse**: Built into Chrome DevTools\n",
    "- **axe DevTools**: Browser extension for auditing accessibility\n",
    "- **Screen Readers**: NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver (Mac)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility is not an optional feature â€” it's a **fundamental aspect of good design**. By following WCAG guidelines and designing perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust content, developers can create inclusive and globally accepted websites.\n",
