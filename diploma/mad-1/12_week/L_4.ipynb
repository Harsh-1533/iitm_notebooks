    "# **Modern Application Development – Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deployment is not just the \"last stage\" of development — it plays a role **throughout the development process**.\n",
    "* The topic covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Version Control**\n",
    "  * **Branches & Git Flow**\n",
    "  * **Centralized vs Distributed Version Control**\n",
    "  * **Continuous Integration (CI)**\n",
    "  * **Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment (CD)**\n",

    "## **1. Version Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Version Control?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: A system for managing changes to code over time.\n",
    "* Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Track changes\n",
    "  * Revert to earlier versions\n",
    "  * Collaborate with others without overwriting work\n",
    "* Git is the **most popular** version control system today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Version Control is Needed**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Incremental Development**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Code is written in steps (e.g., first user UI, then course management, then grading).\n",
    "  * Testing happens along the way to avoid breaking existing functionality.\n",
    "* **Handling Mistakes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If something breaks, need to roll back to a working state.\n",
    "* **Avoid Backup Chaos**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Manual backups lead to too many copies with no clear change history.\n",
    "* **Identifying Breaking Changes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Need to pinpoint which exact change introduced a bug.\n",
    "* **Experimentation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Try new features without affecting the main code.\n",
    "* **Bug Fixing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Isolate bug fixes before merging back into the main code.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **2. Git and Branching**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Master/Main Branch**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The “golden reference” — production-ready code for public release.\n",
    "* **Develop Branch**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Used for active development.\n",
    "* **Feature Branches**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Separate branch for each feature being developed.\n",
    "* **Release Branches**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Created when preparing for a stable release.\n",
    "* **Hotfix Branches**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Created directly from master to fix urgent bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Git Flow Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with `master` (or `main`) branch.\n",
    "2. Create a `develop` branch for active work.\n",
    "3. **Feature development**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Create feature branches from `develop`.\n",
    "   * Merge back into `develop` when done.\n",
    "4. **Release preparation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Create a release branch from `develop`.\n",
    "   * Test, fix bugs, finalize.\n",
    "   * Merge into both `master` and `develop`.\n",
    "5. **Hotfix process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Branch from `master`.\n",
    "   * Fix bug.\n",
    "   * Merge into both `master` and `develop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Push**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Upload branch changes to the central server.\n",
    "* **Merge**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Combine changes from one branch into another.\n",
    "* **Pull Request / Merge Request**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Request to merge code (usually reviewed by another developer before approval).\n",

    "## **3. Centralized vs Distributed Version Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Centralized Version Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Examples**: SVN, CVS\n",
    "* **How it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Single central server.\n",
    "  * Clients check out code.\n",
    "  * Code can be \"locked\" to prevent multiple people editing the same file.\n",
    "* **Drawbacks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Locking can block others if someone forgets to check in.\n",
    "  * Requires constant connection to central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Distributed Version Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example**: Git\n",
    "* **How it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Every developer has a full copy of the repository.\n",
    "  * Changes managed via branches and merges.\n",
    "  * Can work offline.\n",
    "* **Central server optional**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket provide collaboration features.\n",
    "* **Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Flexible workflows.\n",
    "  * No single point of failure.\n",
    "  * Easier branching and merging.\n",

    "* Key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Automation** (most important)\n",
    "  * Integrates changes from multiple developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How CI Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Developers commit changes to version control.\n",
    "* A central CI server:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Automatically compiles (builds) the application.\n",
    "  * Runs all tests.\n",
    "* If tests pass → code is integrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Best Practices for CI**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Write tests before writing code.\n",
    "   * Helps ensure functionality is verified from the start.\n",
    "2. **Code Review**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Experienced developers review code for:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Functionality\n",
    "     * Performance\n",
    "     * Style/readability\n",
    "     * Documentation\n",
    "3. **Optimize Integration Pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Run only necessary tests for faster feedback.\n",
    "   * The integration pipeline is the series of automated steps (build, test, deploy) triggered after a commit.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* After CI passes, package the application so it’s ready for users.\n",
    "* Could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Installable application.\n",
    "  * Server-ready deployment package.\n",
    "* **Automation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scripts can create builds automatically after tests pass.\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Nightly builds (e.g., LibreOffice, Visual Studio Code) — users can download the latest test build daily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Beta testing features.\n",
    "* Getting early feedback from users.\n",

    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extends continuous delivery:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * After CI passes → package is **automatically deployed** to production servers.\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A Flask app is automatically updated on the server after tests pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Users always get the latest bug fixes and features.\n",
    "* No manual update process needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Risks**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If tests miss a bug, it goes directly into production.\n",
    "* Can cause outages or performance issues if something untested slips through.\n",

    "## **8. CI/CD Workflow Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code changes** committed to version control.\n",
    "2. **CI server**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Builds the application.\n",
    "   * Runs tests automatically.\n",
    "3. If tests pass:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Continuous Delivery**: Packages the application for release.\n",
    "   * **Continuous Deployment**: Deploys it directly to production.\n",

    "✅ **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Version control (especially Git) is the foundation for managing code changes.\n",
    "* Branching strategies (e.g., Git Flow) help organize work and releases.\n",
    "* CI automates build and test processes, ensuring stable integration of changes.\n",
    "* CD can mean **delivery** (ready-to-install package) or **deployment** (direct to production).\n",
    "* Automation is central — reduces manual errors and speeds up release cycles.\n",
    "* With great automation comes great responsibility — tests must be comprehensive to avoid pushing bugs to production."
