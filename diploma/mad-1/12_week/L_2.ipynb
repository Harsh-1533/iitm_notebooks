    "# **AppDev – Service Approach 1 (In-Depth Notes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Introduction to the Services Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**:\n",
    "  Instead of a single person or team handling every aspect of building, deploying, and maintaining an app (hardware setup, OS installation, networking, power backup, cooling, monitoring, app code, etc.), the **services approach** breaks the process into specialized tasks handled by different providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Allow specialists to focus on their expertise (e.g., datacenter infrastructure, platform software, app code).\n",
    "  * Developers can concentrate on the application without worrying about the underlying physical or platform setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Acronyms**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **SaaS** – Software as a Service\n",
    "  * **IaaS** – Infrastructure as a Service\n",
    "  * **PaaS** – Platform as a Service\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Specialization in Infrastructure**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Datacenter Operator’s Role\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Infrastructure setup** includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Physical building**: Secure, monitored, and with restricted access.\n",
    "  * **Cooling systems**: Prevent overheating of servers.\n",
    "  * **Security measures**: Protection from unauthorized access, fire, and other hazards.\n",
    "  * **Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS)**: Ensure servers stay online.\n",
    "  * **Reliable network connection**: High-speed and stable internet.\n",
    "* **Developer’s advantage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Assumes there’s always an **“always-on” server** with a permanent IP.\n",
    "  * Can focus purely on **application development**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Breaking Down Services**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Idea**: Identify all tasks needed for deployment and split them into **specialized roles**.\n",
    "* **Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Better reliability (experts maintain their part).\n",
    "  * Faster setup for developers.\n",
    "  * Possible cost savings and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fully hosted software** accessible over the internet without installing locally.\n",
    "* Provider:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Installs and maintains the software.\n",
    "  * Runs it on their own servers/datacenters.\n",
    "  * Ensures security, updates, and uptime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Familiar tools**: Google Docs, Gmail, Google Sheets, Microsoft Office 365.\n",
    "* **Content Management Systems**: WordPress, Drupal (hosted versions).\n",
    "* **Developer tools**: GitLab.com, Redmine (issue tracking).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Deployment Options\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hosted Solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Provider runs everything, user only signs up and uses it.\n",
    "  * Example: GitLab.com account → directly start using repositories.\n",
    "* **Self-Hosted**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Download and install software yourself.\n",
    "  * Full control but also full responsibility for maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* No installation/setup overhead for the user.\n",
    "* Always up-to-date.\n",
    "* Managed security and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provider offers **raw computing resources** (virtual or physical machines).\n",
    "* **Responsibilities**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Provider**: Maintains datacenter, physical hardware, power, and networking.\n",
    "  * **User**: Installs OS, applies security patches, updates software, manages configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to **buying a computer** but hosted remotely and rented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* Major cloud providers: AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure.\n",
    "* Smaller, often cheaper providers: DigitalOcean, Linode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Full control** over the machine’s configuration.\n",
    "* **More responsibility** for maintenance and security.\n",
    "* Choice between large cloud providers (feature-rich) and smaller ones (simpler, cheaper, better price-to-performance in some cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Definition\n",
