    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture explores how traditional **SQL-based relational databases (RDBMS)** compare with modern alternatives like **NoSQL databases**, highlighting various data storage models, trade-offs in consistency, indexing strategies, and data structure principles like **ACID** and **eventual consistency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üî∑ 1. SQL and RDBMS (Relational Databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ What is SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SQL**: Structured Query Language, used to **query structured data**.\n",
    "* SQL is not tied to a specific storage engine; even **Google Sheets** supports a SQL-like interface.\n",
    "* **Main use case**: Querying **relational databases (RDBMS)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üóÇÔ∏è Structure of RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data is stored in **tables** (rows and columns).\n",
    "* **Each row** (tuple) must have the **same columns** (uniform schema).\n",
    "* **Relationships** between entities stored using **foreign keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to **structure** and **index**.\n",
    "* High performance for structured data with **predefined schemas**.\n",
    "* **Indexing** improves query speed on specific columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inflexible when schema varies across entries.\n",
    "* Example: student database where students are either **hostellers** or **day scholars**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Hostellers need mess info.\n",
    "  * Day scholars need gate pass info.\n",
    "  * This leads to many **NULL** values in irrelevant fields.\n",
    "  * Results in **inefficient storage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üî∂ 2. NoSQL: \"Not Only SQL\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßæ What is NoSQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **broad category** of databases that deviate from strict tabular structure.\n",
    "* Supports **flexible schema**, high **scalability**, and **eventual consistency**.\n",
    "* Now interpreted as **Not Only SQL** (i.e., supports SQL-like queries but isn't limited to RDBMS structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üì¶ 3. Types of NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. üìù Document Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store data as **documents**, usually in **JSON** or **BSON** format.\n",
    "* Example document (JSON-like):\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"title\": \"Movie\",\n",
    "    \"info\": {\n",
    "      \"rating\": 8.5,\n",
    "      \"actors\": [\"Actor A\", \"Actor B\"]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Documents in a collection can have **different fields**, unlike rows in SQL tables.\n",
    "* **Indexing** can be done on nested fields (e.g., `info.rating`).\n",
    "* ‚öôÔ∏è Efficient for semi-structured and hierarchical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When data structure can **vary per entity** (e.g., different user profiles).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MongoDB**, **Amazon DocumentDB**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. üîë Key-Value Stores\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each data entry is a **(key, value)** pair.\n",
    "* Efficient for **exact lookups**, like a Python **dictionary**.\n",
    "* Limited for complex queries (e.g., no range queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîß Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Backed by **Hash Tables** or **Search Trees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Storing session data, cache, quick user profile access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redis**, **Memcached**, **BerkeleyDB**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3. üìä Columnar Databases (Column Stores)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store data **column-wise** instead of row-wise.\n",
    "* Traditional RDBMS store full **rows together** (good for row lookups).\n",
    "* Column stores group **values of a column together** for fast **columnar access**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analytical queries like:\n",
    "  *\"Get all users born in 1990\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variants:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wide Column Stores**: Single column contains multiple data fields.\n",
    "* Examples: **Apache Cassandra**, **HBase**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4. üï∏Ô∏è Graph Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represent data as **nodes** (entities) and **edges** (relationships).\n",
    "* Best for representing **connected data**.\n",
    "* Examples: social networks, maps, recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find shortest paths, mutual friends, introductions (e.g., LinkedIn).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Neo4j**, **ArangoDB**, **OrientDB**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5. ‚è±Ô∏è Time Series Databases (TSDB)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specialized databases for storing **time-indexed data** (e.g., sensor logs).\n",
    "* Focus on **performance over time** and **aggregations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monitoring metrics, tracking website hits over time, IoT data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficient **time-based querying**\n",
    "* Support for **data rollups** (aggregating past data, e.g., daily/monthly summaries)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popular tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **InfluxDB**, **Prometheus**, **RRDTool**, **OpenTSDB**, **Graphite**\n",
