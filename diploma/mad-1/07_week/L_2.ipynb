    "\n",
    "### 📌 **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O notation is used to describe the **asymptotic upper bound** of an algorithm’s **time** or **space complexity** in terms of the input size $N$. It gives a high-level understanding of the performance and scalability of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Key Concept**: “Order of Magnitude”\n",
    "\n",
    "* Big-O describes how the runtime **grows** as the size of the input $N$ increases.\n",
    "* Constants and lower-order terms are **ignored** in Big-O notation.\n",

    "#### 🧱 Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A → B → C → ... → Z\n",
    "* Each element points to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔁 Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To find Z, you must traverse A → B → C → ... → Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⏱ Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Worst Case**: $O(N)$\n",
    "* **Average Case**: $O(N/2)$ → still $O(N)$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inefficient for large datasets.\n",
    "* Requires sequential traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 **Linear Search in an Array (Unsorted)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧱 Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elements stored in contiguous memory.\n",
    "* Can access any index directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔁 Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start from index 0 and go till you find the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⏱ Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Still O(N)** – as there’s no order or indexing to exploit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 **Binary Search in a Sorted Array**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📋 Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data **must be sorted**.\n",
    "* Must support **random access** (e.g., array).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔁 Search Process (Example):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let’s say you're looking for ‘P’ in sorted array A-Z:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Compare with middle element (M).\n",
    "  2. Since P > M, discard left half.\n",
    "  3. Repeat on the right half (T), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📈 Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* At each step, we halve the search space.\n",
    "* Takes $\\log_2 N$ steps → **O(log N)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Benefits:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Each node has up to two children:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Left child < Node < Right child\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔁 Search:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### ⏱ Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Best/Average Case**: $O(\\log N)$\n",
    "* **Worst Case** (unbalanced tree): $O(N)$\n",

    "#### ⚠️ Issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unbalanced trees** degrade to linked lists.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.3 **B-Trees (and B+ Trees)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 💡 What makes them special?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designed for **disk-based storage**.\n",
    "* Nodes store **multiple keys** (not just 2 children).\n",
    "* Minimize disk I/O by reading **large blocks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧱 Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Internal nodes store keys and child pointers.\n",
    "* Leaf nodes contain actual data (in B+ trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔁 Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All search operations are kept at **logarithmic complexity** $O(\\log N)$\n",
    "* B+ Trees keep data **only in leaf nodes**, which makes range queries faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Used in:\n",

    "Use a **hash function** to map keys to memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📥 Insert/Search:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute hash(key) → index\n",

    "* Resolved by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Chaining** (store as list)\n",
    "  * **Open Addressing** (find next empty spot)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not sorted\n",
    "* Not suitable for range queries\n",
    "* Needs a good hash function\n",
