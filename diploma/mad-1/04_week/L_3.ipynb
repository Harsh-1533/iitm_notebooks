    "### ðŸ”¹ **1. Structured vs Unstructured Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¸ What is a **Structured Database**?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data is stored in a **fixed format** â€” like tables (rows and columns).\n",
    "* Easy to **search**, **filter**, and **update**.\n",
    "* Uses languages like **SQL** to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a table storing student data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Name | Age |\n",
    "| -- | ---- | --- |\n",
    "| 1  | Raj  | 18  |\n",
    "| 2  | Neha | 19  |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is structured â€” every row and column has a clear meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¸ What is an **Unstructured Database**?\n",
    "\n",
    "* No fixed format â€” data could be images, emails, PDFs, videos.\n",
    "* Harder to search and manage.\n",
    "* Uses NoSQL databases like MongoDB, or cloud storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A folder with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `photo.jpg`\n",
    "* `resume.pdf`\n",
    "* `voice_note.mp3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Thatâ€™s unstructured â€” you can't query it with SQL directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **2. Adding, Updating, Deleting Data in Structured Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **SQL**, you use basic commands:\n",

    "| Task   | SQL Command                                   | Meaning                           |\n",
    "| ------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |\n",
    "| Add    | `INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Raj');`     | Adds a new student                |\n",
    "| Update | `UPDATE students SET name='Neha' WHERE id=1;` | Changes name of student with ID 1 |\n",
    "| Delete | `DELETE FROM students WHERE id=1;`            | Deletes the student with ID 1     |\n",

    "### ðŸ”¹ **3. What is a Relationship in a Database?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When **tables are connected**, we call it a **relationship**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸŽ“ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Name |\n",
    "| -- | ---- |\n",
    "| 1  | Raj  |\n",

    "**Course Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "| CourseID | StudentID | CourseName |\n",
    "| -------- | --------- | ---------- |\n",
    "| 101      | 1         | Math       |\n",

    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ§¾ ER Diagram: Entity-Relationship Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s a **picture** that shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Entities** (tables)\n",
    "* **Attributes** (columns)\n",
    "* **Relationships** (connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”— Relationship Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-to-One**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * One entity connects to only one other.\n",
    "   * Example: 1 student â†” 1 Aadhaar card.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **One-to-Many**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * One entity connects to **many** of another.\n",
    "   * Example: 1 teacher â†” many students.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Many-to-Many**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Many entities relate to many others.\n",
    "   * Example: Students â†” Courses (many students take many courses).\n",
