    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¸ 1. What is **Persistent Storage**?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you save something like a file, contact, or database entry â€” and it **remains saved even after turning off the system** â€” thatâ€™s **persistent storage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: When you save a contact on your phone, and it's still there tomorrow â€” that's persistence.\n",
    "* Contrast: RAM is **not** persistent â€” it forgets everything once power is lost.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¸ 2. Why Do We Need **Data Structures** in Storage?\n",
    "\n",
    "To **store and retrieve** data quickly and efficiently, we donâ€™t just throw data randomly on disk. We use **data structures** to organize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Structure  | Use in Storage                                |\n",
    "| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Array**       | Store rows of a table                         |\n",
    "| **Hash Table**  | Quick lookup for values (like user by ID)     |\n",
    "| **B-tree**      | Used in databases to index and sort data fast |\n",
    "| **Linked List** | Sometimes used in logs or journaling systems  |\n",
    "\n",
    "These make storage **structured, searchable, and fast**.\n",

    "## ðŸ”¸ 3. What are **Relational Databases**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational Databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) store data in **tables**, and the tables have **relations**.\n",

    "| 2  | John     | USA     |\n",
    "+----+----------+---------+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Query** this table using SQL\n",
    "* Link it to other tables (e.g., Orders) via **relationships**\n",
    "* Enforce rules (e.g., no duplicate IDs)\n",

    "| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Atomicity**   | All steps in a task happen completely or not at all (no half-saved data). |\n",
    "| **Consistency** | Data must follow rules (e.g., no text in a number column).                |\n",
    "| **Isolation**   | Tasks by different users shouldn't interfere.                             |\n",
    "| **Durability**  | Once data is saved, it stays saved, even after a crash.                   |\n",

    "* **Relational Databases** use structured tables and SQL to manage data.\n",
