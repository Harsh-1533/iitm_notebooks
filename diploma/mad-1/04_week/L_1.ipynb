    "### ðŸ”¸ **Persistent Storage â€” Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Persistent storage** refers to any data storage that retains information even after the application or system is turned off. Unlike RAM (which is temporary), persistent storage ensures that data remains available between user sessions.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¸ **In MVC: Model and Persistent Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model** is responsible for handling the data and business logic.\n",
    "* This includes **accessing, updating, and storing data**.\n",
    "* **Persistent storage** is the *back-end part* of the Model â€” where actual data is saved (e.g., in a database, file, or cloud).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¸ **Why Persistent Storage is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevents **data loss** after app shutdown or crash.\n",
    "* Allows **data sharing** between sessions or users.\n",
    "* Enables **structured access** and modification using queries or APIs.\n",

    "### ðŸ”¸ **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a **student attendance system**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model** holds data like student names and attendance logs.\n",
    "* **Persistent storage** saves this data in a database.\n",
    "* When the app restarts, the same data is **retrieved from the storage** and displayed.\n",

    "### âœ… **Learning Outcomes Recap**\n",
    "\n",
    "By studying persistent storage, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand how the **Model stores and retrieves data**.\n",
    "* Learn how **structured data (like tables or objects)** is managed.\n",
    "* Can create apps where data **doesnâ€™t disappear after closing**."
