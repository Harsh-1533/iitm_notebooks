    "## 🎯 **Learning Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the concept of API design and its role in web architectures.\n",
    "* Learn about REST (Representational State Transfer) and how its constraints shape modern web application design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔶 Part 1: Understanding API Design in the Context of Web Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**.\n",
    "* It defines a **set of rules and protocols** that allow different software systems (usually client and server) to communicate.\n",
    "* APIs abstract the implementation and allow interaction with the application without exposing internal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A weather app on your phone uses APIs to request weather data from a server. The API defines how to make requests and how the server responds (e.g., JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 Web Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web as a Distributed System:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client**: The device/user that initiates the request (browser, mobile app, etc.).\n",
    "* **Server**: Hosts the data or business logic and processes requests.\n",
    "* **Network**: Connects clients and servers—can span across the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why APIs Matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In distributed architectures, **standard protocols** and **interfaces** are necessary to ensure reliable communication.\n",
    "* APIs define the contract between the client and server.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔷 Part 2: REST – Representational State Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 What is REST?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Defined by **Roy Fielding** in his PhD thesis (2000).\n",
    "* REST is a **software architectural style** for designing networked applications.\n",
    "* Not a protocol or a standard—but a set of **guidelines or constraints** to be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Core Principles / Constraints of REST\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Client-Server Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Separation of concerns**: The client handles UI/UX; the server handles data and logic.\n",
    "* Enables independent development and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Statelessness\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Each request from client to server must contain all the information needed** to understand and process the request.\n",
    "* **Server does not retain client context** between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✔️ Implication: Makes servers more scalable and simplifies recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Cacheability\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Responses must explicitly indicate if they are cacheable**.\n",
    "* Enables temporary storage of frequently accessed data (e.g., HTML, images).\n",
    "* Reduces server load and improves response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📝 HTTP headers like `Cache-Control`, `Expires` help control this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Layered System\n",
    "\n",
    "* The client does not know whether it is directly connected to the end server or an intermediary (like a load balancer or proxy).\n",
    "* **Allows architectural flexibility**—intermediaries can enforce security, caching, logging, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: Google frontend may serve HTML while backend handles logic; middleware may enforce authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ Uniform Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "* The most important REST constraint.\n",
    "* Ensures standardized interaction between components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Resources are identified via URIs** (`/products`, `/users/123`)\n",
    "* **Standard HTTP Methods**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `GET`: Retrieve resource\n",
    "  * `POST`: Create new resource\n",
    "  * `PUT`: Update/replace resource\n",
    "  * `DELETE`: Remove resource\n",
    "* **Self-descriptive messages**: Metadata (headers, status codes) describe the message\n",
    "* **Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)**: Responses can include links to related actions/resources\n",
    "\n",
    "> 📌 Benefit: Promotes predictability, scalability, and decoupling of client-server.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6️⃣ Code on Demand (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Servers can send executable code to clients (e.g., JavaScript, Java applets) to **extend functionality dynamically**.\n",
    "* Rarely enforced in modern RESTful APIs due to security concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 Additional Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ OpenAPI Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine-readable format** (usually in YAML or JSON).\n",
    "* Describes endpoints, input/output formats, authentication methods.\n",
    "* Useful for **documentation**, **automation**, and **client SDK generation**.\n",
    "\n",

    "* REST is a **guiding philosophy** for designing web APIs—not a rulebook.\n",
    "* Following REST principles leads to robust, scalable, and maintainable applications.\n",
    "* REST APIs are **language-agnostic** and work over standard HTTP protocols.\n",
