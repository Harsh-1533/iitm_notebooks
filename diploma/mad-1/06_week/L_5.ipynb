    "## ✅ REST API Concepts and Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Why API Documentation is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "* APIs allow interaction between **client** and **server**, hiding internal implementation details (information hiding).\n",
    "* E.g., A client can use a weather API without knowing whether the server uses **MySQL, PostgreSQL**, or something else.\n",
    "* Key principle: **Separation of concerns** — client and server operate independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Why Stability of API Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* APIs act as **contracts** between client and server.\n",
    "* If a server changes the API without notice, client applications break.\n",
    "* Hence, APIs must:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Be **versioned** (e.g., `/v1`, `/v2`)\n",
    "  * Avoid breaking changes without notice\n",
    "  * Provide **backward compatibility** during transitions\n",

    "## 🔍 Solution: Machine-Readable API Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Description Files\n",
    "\n",
    "* Files that **formally describe** an API’s structure.\n",
    "* Can be used to **auto-generate code** or documentation (called **scaffolding**).\n",
    "* Enable **automatic tools** to read and understand APIs without manual reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "* **XML**: Structured, self-descriptive markup language suitable for defining tag-based data.\n",
    "* **JSON-based schemas**: Also widely used today.\n",

    "### 🔸 What is OAS?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **vendor-neutral** specification for **HTTP-based remote APIs**.\n",
    "* Aims to describe web APIs in a **machine-readable format**.\n",
    "* Allows tools to **auto-generate**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Documentation\n",
    "  * Client SDKs\n",
    "  * Server stubs\n",
    "  * Test cases\n",

    "### 🔸 Features of OAS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clearly defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Endpoints (URLs)\n",
    "  * HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)\n",
    "  * Input parameters\n",
    "  * Request/response formats\n",
    "  * Response codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)\n",
    "* Helps consumers know **what to expect** from an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 History\n",
    "\n",
    "* Originated from a tool called **Swagger** (by SmartBear).\n",
    "* Swagger 2.0 → evolved into **OpenAPI 3.0** (as of Aug 2021).\n",
    "* Tools like **Swagger UI**, **Swagger Editor**, and **Swagger Codegen** still support OAS and are widely used.\n",
