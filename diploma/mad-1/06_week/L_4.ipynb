    "### âœ… **Key Concepts from the CoWIN API Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ **1. Real-world REST API Example: CoWIN**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used for **vaccine slot search, booking, and certificate downloads**.\n",
    "* Built using **REST principles** and **public APIs**.\n",
    "* Large-scale system handling **millions of users**, so efficiency and protection from abuse are crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ **2. Types of CoWIN APIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Public APIs (Unauthenticated)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For information like **vaccine slot availability**.\n",
    "  * Example: `findByPin` API â€” allows searching for centers by **PIN code and date**.\n",
    "* **Protected APIs (Authenticated)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For actions like **booking appointments** or **downloading certificates**.\n",
    "  * Requires authentication tokens (usually obtained via OTP or login).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ **3. Using APIs with cURL**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example GET request to CoWIN API using `curl`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  curl -X GET \"https://cdn-api.co-vin.in/api/v2/appointment/sessions/public/findByPin?pincode=600028&date=04-08-2021\" \\\n",
    "       -H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n",
    "       -H \"Accept-Language: en_US\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ **4. JSON Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Response contains detailed structured information:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `center_id`, `name`, `address`, `available_capacity`, `vaccine`, `fee_type`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ **5. Rate Limits and Ethical API Usage**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Never overload public health APIs.\n",
    "* Avoid sending large volumes of automated requests (especially for health apps).\n",
    "* Respect API providers by following their **terms of use** and **rate limits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ **6. Authentication Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Token-based authentication**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * OTP is used to authenticate a user and return a **temporary token**.\n",
    "  * Token is required in `Authorization` header for protected API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API Keys** (used in other APIs like GitHub, Twitter, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ§  Learning Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* REST APIs are used **not just for data** but also for **actions** (e.g., booking a slot, rebooting a server).\n",
    "* APIs separate **frontend and backend**, enabling flexible app development.\n",
    "* Public APIs like **Wikipedia** and **CoWIN** show how APIs can support both **information retrieval** and **remote actions**.\n",
    "* Always **document**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Endpoints (`routes`)\n",
    "  * HTTP Methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)\n",
    "  * Headers\n",
    "  * Parameters (required/optional)\n",
    "  * Response formats (e.g., JSON)\n",
    "  * Status codes (`200`, `400`, `500`, etc.)\n",
