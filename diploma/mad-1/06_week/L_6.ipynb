    "Here are **in-depth notes** based on the entire lecture you shared on **Modern Application Development – API Design & OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Core Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **API** (Application Programming Interface): A contract between client and server for interaction.\n",
    "* Allows a client to use functionalities provided by the server without needing to know internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Key Principles of Web APIs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Information Hiding**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clients should not know how the server stores data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).\n",
    "* They only interact through APIs.\n",
    "* This leads to **loose coupling** and **separation of concerns**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Unbreakable Contracts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once a client depends on an API, changes to it must be carefully managed.\n",
    "* **Versioning** (like `v1`, `v2`) is used to ensure backward compatibility.\n",
    "* Breaking changes should always be released as a **new version**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Problem with Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Human-written documentation issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subjective (quality depends on the writer).\n",
    "* May be **incomplete**, **outdated**, or **language-specific**.\n",
    "* Hard for machines to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Solution: Machine-Readable Specification**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Use of **Description Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A structured, machine-readable way to describe APIs.\n",
    "* Example: **YAML** or **JSON** formats.\n",
    "* Enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Code scaffolding / boilerplate generation\n",
    "  * Automatic documentation\n",
    "  * Tool compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **OAS** is a **vendor-neutral**, **HTTP-based** standard for web APIs.\n",
    "* Originated from **Swagger**.\n",
    "* Current version (as of Aug 2021): **OAS 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 Swagger Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Swagger UI (interactive docs)\n",
    "* Swagger Codegen\n",
    "* Swagger Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Minimal OpenAPI Example in YAML**\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "openapi: 3.1.0\n",
    "info:\n",
    "  title: Minimal API\n",
    "  version: 0.001\n",
    "paths: {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `openapi`: version of the spec used.\n",
    "* `info`: title and version of API.\n",
    "* `paths`: Endpoints (empty here).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Structure of OpenAPI Document**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **openapi**: Version of the OpenAPI used.\n",
    "2. **info**: Title, version, description.\n",
    "3. **paths**: All API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **What is an Endpoint?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **URL + HTTP method** (e.g., `GET /board`).\n",
    "* Defined under the `paths` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Operation Object for an Endpoint**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each endpoint can have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `summary`: Short explanation\n",
    "* `description`: Detailed explanation\n",
    "* `parameters`: (Path/query/body)\n",
    "* `requestBody`: Structure of expected input\n",
    "* `responses`: Possible status codes & content\n",
    "* `content`: Format (e.g., `application/json`)\n",
    "* `schema`: Structure of response data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Content Negotiation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clients can ask for different formats (`JSON`, `HTML`, etc.) via the `Accept` header.\n",
    "* Server responds with appropriate format if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Request Parameters & Body**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Path Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "/users/{id}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `{id}` is a required parameter.\n",
    "* Must be specified in requests like `/users/23`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Request Body\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "requestBody:\n",
    "  content:\n",
    "    application/json:\n",
    "      schema:\n",
    "        type: object\n",
    "        properties:\n",
    "          name:\n",
    "            type: string\n",
    "          price:\n",
    "            type: number\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Why OpenAPI is Useful**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enables **code generation**.\n",
    "* Facilitates **automated documentation**.\n",
    "* Keeps **API, docs, and logic in sync**.\n",
    "* Supports **Design First** development.\n",
    "* Acts as a **Single Source of Truth** (SSOT).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Best Practices in API Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Design First, Code Later**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Define structure clearly before coding.\n",
    "2. **Use Specification Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Don’t manually write YAML – use Swagger Editor, Postman, or other GUI tools.\n",
    "3. **Version Control the Specification**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Track changes using Git or similar tools.\n",
    "4. **Make APIs Public When Possible**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Encourages external development and innovation.\n",
    "5. **Avoid Divergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Don’t let code and docs diverge — generate one from the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 **Learning Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the **purpose of API specifications**.\n",
    "* Know how to create a **minimal OpenAPI document**.\n",
    "* Understand how API **paths, operations, and schemas** are structured.\n",
    "* Be familiar with **best practices** in API development using OAS."
