    "## ðŸ”‘ **Key Concepts Explained in the Lecture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **What REST Enables**\n",
    "\n",
    "* REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architectural style used to **transfer state and data** over HTTP.\n",
    "* REST is commonly used in **CRUD operations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **C**reate\n",
    "  * **R**ead\n",
    "  * **U**pdate\n",
    "  * **D**elete\n",
    "* REST APIs are not limited to CRUD. They can perform **actions like rebooting a VM**, **turning on lights**, etc. These are **command-based tasks** and not just data access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Use of REST in Google Cloud and Smart Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "* REST APIs are used in cloud platforms (like Google Cloud) to manage resources.\n",
    "* Even physical systems (like smart street lights) can be controlled through RESTful endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Real-World REST API Example â€“ Wikipedia**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ“š **Why Does Wikipedia Need an API?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Beyond browsing, developers might want to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Search pages programmatically\n",
    "  * Retrieve metadata (like edit history, contributors)\n",
    "  * Get summaries or page titles starting with specific letters\n",
    "* Instead of manually parsing HTML, they can use a **clean API returning JSON** data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Structure of a Wikipedia REST API Call**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/rest.php/v1/search/page?q=earth&limit=1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `en.wikipedia.org`: English version of Wikipedia\n",
    "* `/w/rest.php`: Access REST API (not HTML page)\n",
    "* `/v1`: API version\n",
    "* `/search/page`: The endpoint (resource)\n",
    "* `?q=earth&limit=1`: Query string parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `q=earth`: Search term\n",
    "  * `limit=1`: Limit results\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **How to Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `curl` or any HTTP client to hit the endpoint.\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/rest.php/v1/search/page?q=earth&limit=1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Youâ€™ll get:\n",
    "\n",
    "* JSON response containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `title`, `description`, `excerpt`, and `thumbnail`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Understanding the JSON Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "* JSON is used for data interchange because itâ€™s lightweight and easy to parse.\n",
    "* A REST API typically returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"pages\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"id\": 9228,\n",
    "        \"key\": \"Earth\",\n",
    "        \"title\": \"Earth\",\n",
    "        \"excerpt\": \"Earth is the third planet...\",\n",
    "        \"description\": \"Third planet from the Sun...\",\n",
    "        \"thumbnail\": {...}\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **API Documentation and Schema**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Good APIs provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Schema** (structure of data)\n",
    "  * **Route** (path to use in URL)\n",
    "  * **Method** (GET, POST, etc.)\n",
    "  * **Parameters** (required/optional, types)\n",
    "  * **Response Codes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `200`: Success\n",
    "    * `400`: Client error (e.g., missing query `q`)\n",
    "    * `500`: Internal server error\n",
    "  * **Examples** to help users understand how to call the API\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… **Learning Outcomes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the purpose and scope of REST APIs**\n",
    "2. **Describe how REST APIs are used in real-world applications** like Wikipedia or Google Cloud\n",
    "3. **Use tools like `curl` to interact with a REST API**\n",
    "4. **Interpret JSON responses returned from an API**\n",
    "5. **Read API documentation and understand routes, parameters, and response codes**\n",
    "6. **Realize the importance of API versioning** and structured documentation\n",
