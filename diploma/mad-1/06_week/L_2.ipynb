    "Here’s a detailed, structured set of **notes on REST and REST-based application development**, based on the full lecture you provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌐 **Understanding REST (Representational State Transfer)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ **Definition & Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "* REST is a **software architectural style** used in **web services**.\n",
    "* It enables interaction between a **client** and a **server** where **state information** of their interaction is transferred via a **representation** (text, JSON, etc.).\n",
    "* Commonly used for **distributed systems** and **web APIs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔄 State Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "* REST involves the **transfer of interaction state** (e.g., shopping cart actions).\n",
    "* Each request between client and server includes **sufficient information** to understand the context — no session is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Statelessness\n",
    "\n",
    "* The server **does not store** client state across requests.\n",
    "* Any required context (e.g., login info via cookies) must be included in each request.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 **Resource and Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📍Resource Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Resources (e.g., user data, shopping cart) are identified by **URIs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier) = a superset of **URL**.\n",
    "* Client accesses resources via URIs and performs actions on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛠 HTTP Methods in REST (Verbs)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Operation | REST Meaning                                   | Idempotent |\n",
    "| ------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n",
    "| GET    | Read      | Retrieve a resource                            | ✅ Yes      |\n",
    "| POST   | Create    | Submit data to be processed                    | ❌ No       |\n",
    "| PUT    | Replace   | Create or update a resource with a specific ID | ✅ Yes      |\n",
    "| DELETE | Remove    | Delete a specified resource                    | ✅ Yes      |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚦 Idempotent Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "* An operation is **idempotent** if repeating it doesn’t change the result beyond the initial request.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **GET, PUT, DELETE** are idempotent.\n",
    "  * **POST** is **not** idempotent (e.g., may create duplicate records on multiple submissions).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **REST vs CRUD**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CRUD** = Create, Read, Update, Delete (from databases).\n",
    "* REST can be used to **implement CRUD operations**, but REST is about **web architecture**, not just databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **Data Encoding in REST**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌐 HTML vs Machine Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "* Traditional websites return **HTML**, meant for **human** viewing.\n",
    "* REST APIs return **machine-readable** data like **JSON**, **XML**, or **YAML**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧱 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lightweight format for **structured data**.\n",
    "* Easy to read, write, parse (especially in JS and Python).\n",
    "* **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  {\n",
    "    \"firstName\": \"John\",\n",
    "    \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n",
    "    \"age\": 27,\n",
    "    \"address\": {\n",
    "      \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n",
    "      \"postalCode\": \"10021\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    \"phoneNumbers\": [\n",
    "      {\"type\": \"home\", \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"},\n",
    "      {\"type\": \"fax\", \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"}\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 YAML (Yet Another Markup Language)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alternative to JSON, often used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Configuration files.\n",
    "  * API documentation (e.g., **OpenAPI Specification** or OAS).\n",
    "* More human-readable than JSON but used less in data exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 REST Application Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Client** requests a resource via a URI.\n",
    "2. Chooses an operation (**GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**).\n",
    "3. **Server** responds with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A new resource,\n",
    "   * Confirmation,\n",
    "   * Or error (based on context and state).\n",
    "4. **Data format** used: JSON/XML/YAML (not HTML).\n",
    "5. **View and model** are separated — Controller receives structured data and decides how to present it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Learning Outcomes Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grasped the **REST architecture** and the importance of **representational state transfer**.\n",
    "* Understood how REST uses **HTTP methods** to operate on web resources.\n",
    "* Distinguished between **REST and CRUD**.\n",
    "* Learned about **stateless communication** and **idempotency**.\n",
    "* Explored **JSON and YAML** as preferred formats for **API communication**.\n",
