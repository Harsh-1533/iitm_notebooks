    "### üìå **Controller in MVC: Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "A *Controller* is a central component in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern that handles **user requests**, executes **appropriate actions**, and selects the **correct View** to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß **Actions Performed by Controller**\n",
    "\n",
    "Controllers define **actions** which are units of behavior a user can request. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CRUD operations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `Create`: Add new data\n",
    "  * `Read`: Fetch data\n",
    "  * `Update`: Modify existing data\n",
    "  * `Delete`: Remove data\n",
    "* Other domain-specific actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sending emails\n",
    "  * Logging events\n",
    "  * Submitting a quiz\n",
    "  * Requesting alerts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üóÇÔ∏è **Grouping Actions Logically**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Actions that operate on the **same data model** (like `Photo`, `User`, `Post`) are **grouped together into a single controller**.\n",
    "* For example: `PhotoController` may contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `index()` ‚Äì show all photos\n",
    "  * `create()` ‚Äì show form to add a photo\n",
    "  * `store()` ‚Äì save photo\n",
    "  * `show(id)` ‚Äì display a single photo\n",
    "  * `edit(id)` ‚Äì show edit form\n",
    "  * `update(id)` ‚Äì update photo\n",
    "  * `destroy(id)` ‚Äì delete photo\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåê **HTTP Verbs and CRUD**\n",
    "\n",
    "Controllers handle HTTP requests using standard verbs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| HTTP Verb | Action | CRUD Mapping    |\n",
    "| --------- | ------ | --------------- |\n",
    "| GET       | Read   | `index`, `show` |\n",
    "| POST      | Create | `store`         |\n",
    "| PUT/PATCH | Update | `update`        |\n",
    "| DELETE    | Delete | `destroy`       |\n",
    "\n",
    "* These are **conventions**, not rules. A GET request *can* delete data, but it‚Äôs not good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ **Controller‚Äôs Role in MVC**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Receives input** via HTTP request (from View)\n",
    "* **Talks to Model** (never directly to the database)\n",
    "* **Returns a View** as the response\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùó Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Never embed SQL queries** directly in controller logic ‚Äî that‚Äôs Model's job.\n",
    "* **Views and Controllers** are more tightly coupled (controller knows which view to render).\n",
    "* **Models and Views** should be loosely coupled.\n",
    "* Controllers **encapsulate logic** relevant to a specific model or functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Controllers group logically related **actions**.\n",
    "* Used to **handle requests**, interact with **models**, and render **views**.\n",
    "* Frameworks like Laravel offer built-in support for grouping CRUD operations via **Resource Controllers**.\n",
