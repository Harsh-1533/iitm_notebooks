    "## üìå **Topic: Routes and Controllers in Web Applications**\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ **Learning Outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand how **controllers** are implemented using **routes**\n",
    "* Introduction to **Python decorators**\n",
    "* Learn basic **Flask routing** with examples\n",
    "* Understand how **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, etc.) map to controller functions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ **Client-Server Model & Stateless Nature**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web applications follow a **stateless** client-server model.\n",
    "* The server doesn‚Äôt remember the client‚Äôs previous state.\n",
    "* All client interactions are through **HTTP requests**, and the server must respond based only on the **incoming request**, without assumptions about prior state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåê **HTTP Requests Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requests include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Verb** (e.g., GET, POST)\n",
    "  * **URL** (context/path)\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `GET /course/assessment` ‚Äì Fetch an assessment page\n",
    "  * `POST /quiz/submit` ‚Äì Submit quiz responses\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ **Routing: Mapping URL to Actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The application needs to **map URLs to corresponding actions**.\n",
    "* Flask handles this using **route decorators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß© **Python Decorators**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **decorator** adds additional behavior to a function without modifying it.\n",
    "* Syntax: `@decorator_name`\n",
    "* In Flask: `@app.route(\"/\")` maps a URL to a specific controller function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß **Basic Flask Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\")\n",
    "def home():\n",
    "    return \"Hello World\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* When `GET /` is called, Flask routes the request to `home()` and returns the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† **Important Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flask builds a **routing table** using decorators like `@app.route`.\n",
    "* Flask does **strict routing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If you define `@app.route(\"/\")` for `GET`, it won‚Äôt respond to `POST /`.\n",
    "  * If a wrong method is used, Flask throws an error (safe against malicious usage).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîê **HTTP Verbs & Controller Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GET**: Retrieve resources\n",
    "* **POST**: Create or update resources\n",
    "* **DELETE**: Remove resources\n",
    "* **PUT/PATCH**: Modify existing resources\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì• **Dynamic Routes with Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.route(\"/<int:user_id>\", methods=[\"GET\"])\n",
    "def show(user_id):\n",
    "    # Logic to fetch and return user details\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flask extracts `user_id` and passes it to `show()`.\n",
    "* For `/42`, Flask would call `show(42)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üóÉÔ∏è **Examples of RESTful Mappings**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Route Pattern         | Method | Function    | Purpose            |\n",
    "| --------------------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------ |\n",
    "| `/`                   | GET    | `index()`   | Show home page     |\n",
    "| `/create`             | POST   | `store()`   | Store new entry    |\n",
    "| `/<int:user_id>`      | GET    | `show()`    | Show specific user |\n",
    "| `/<int:user_id>/edit` | POST   | `update()`  | Update user info   |\n",
    "| `/<int:user_id>`      | DELETE | `destroy()` | Delete user        |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîí **Security Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Destructive operations (like `DELETE`) must be protected with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Authentication**\n",
    "  * **Tokens / CSRF Protection**\n",
    "* Prevents attackers from invoking destructive routes via crafted URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß± **Flask & MVC**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flask is **not inherently MVC**, but it supports MVC **style** design.\n",
    "* MVC in Flask is a **design philosophy**, not a rigid framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Model**: Data structures (e.g., SQLAlchemy ORM)\n",
    "  * **View**: Templates (HTML/Jinja)\n",
    "  * **Controller**: Flask route functions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Routing** connects client requests (URLs + HTTP verbs) to **controller functions**.\n",
    "* Flask uses **decorators** like `@app.route()` to manage these routes.\n",
    "* MVC is a **mental model** for separating concerns, not enforced by Flask.\n",
    "* Flask is **lightweight** and flexible‚Äîlets you adopt MVC without enforcing it.\n",
    "* Always **design with security and statelessness** in mind.\n",
