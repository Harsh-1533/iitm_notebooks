    "# **AppDev – Levels of Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Requirements Gathering – The Foundation of Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any code is written, the **initial requirements gathering** phase sets the groundwork for the application.\n",
    "For the Online Degree Dashboard example (`onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in`), this process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **a. Identifying Stakeholders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders = individuals/groups with a vested interest in the application’s functioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Students** (primary users)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * View courses registered\n",
    "  * Add/drop/modify courses\n",
    "  * Download certificates for completed courses\n",
    "* **Administrators**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Manage student database\n",
    "  * Limited group with special privileges\n",
    "* **Teachers** (optional in this system, but possible)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Update course material, if dashboard supports it\n",
    "\n",
    "### **b. Functional Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional requirements define **what the app should do**.\n",
    "Examples for the student dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "* View latest updates\n",
    "* Register exam hall preferences\n",
    "* Download hall tickets\n",
    "* Update course registrations (e.g., drop courses)\n",
    "* View completed courses\n",
    "\n",
    "Each functional requirement maps to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **controller** (business logic)\n",
    "* One or more **views** (UI components)\n",
    "* Interaction with **models** (data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\"Register exam hall preferences\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Controller: Edit controller for exam hall selection\n",
    "* View: Drop-down list + Submit button\n",
    "* Model: Student data update in DB\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. Non-Functional Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not directly related to behavior, but affect usability & experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Page color, font size/type\n",
    "* Placement & type of logo\n",
    "* Navigation structure\n",
    "* General UI/UX guidelines (header, footer, navigation menus)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are important for **user experience** but don’t map to controllers/models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **d. Avoiding Ambiguity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language (e.g., English) is ambiguous. Requirements must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Specific** (no vague terms like “update course” without clarifying limits)\n",
    "* **Complete** (cover all possible scenarios)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Ambiguity:** “Student should be able to update course registration”\n",
    "Clarify:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can they add new courses anytime?\n",
    "* Can they modify others’ registrations?\n",
    "* Are there deadlines?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **e. Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases = step-by-step scenarios showing how a feature works.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduces ambiguity\n",
    "* Helps both developers & testers understand workflows\n",
    "* **Example:** “Student adds a course” → step list → maps directly to test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. From Requirements to Units of Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking requirements into **small, testable units**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example units:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * View list of courses\n",
    "  * Edit course status\n",
    "  * Edit exam preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Corresponds to a **controller** + related views/models\n",
    "* Can be assigned to different developers in parallel\n",
    "* Maintains modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Unit Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Testing an individual component in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **a. Scope**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually tests a single controller method\n",
    "* Can also test part of a controller (e.g., GET vs POST handling separately)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **b. Designing Unit Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clearly define **inputs** and **expected outputs**\n",
    "* Decide if unit can be tested in isolation or requires setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Add student to course” requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Student exists in DB\n",
    "  * Course exists in DB\n",
    "* Use **dummy/test database** (never live data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. Key Testing Scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Valid cases**: Correct inputs → correct outputs\n",
    "* **Invalid cases**: Incorrect data → proper error handling (no crashes)\n",
    "* **Edge cases**: Duplicate registrations, missing data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **d. Test-Driven Development (TDD)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write all tests **before** writing code\n",
    "* Initially, all tests fail\n",
    "* Implement features until tests pass\n",
    "* Tests become part of **regression test suite** (detect future breaks)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Integration Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Testing the interaction between **multiple modules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **a. Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even if units work individually, combined modules may fail due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Dependency mismatches\n",
    "  * Miscommunication between developers\n",
    "  * Interface inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### **b. Example Integration Scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Student management + Payment gateway\n",
    "* Student + Course + Admin modules\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. Continuous Integration (CI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automated integration testing triggered on every **commit** to main branch\n",
    "* Uses tools like **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI/CD**\n",
    "* Tests combined module functionality often (multiple times a day)\n",
    "* Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Catch problems early\n",
    "  * Encourage communication between developers\n",

    "\n",
    "* Includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * All integrated modules\n",
    "  * Actual deployment server/environment\n",
    "* Often **black-box testing** (focus on inputs/outputs, not internal code)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **b. Example for Online Degree Dashboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy to **Google App Engine**\n",
    "* Use a **test domain** for trial runs\n",
    "* Run both automated and manual tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. Non-Functional System Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance testing**: Response time under load\n",
    "* **Scalability testing**: How system handles more users\n",
    "* **Cost efficiency**: Resource usage vs expense\n",

    "## **6. System Test Automation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **a. Challenges**\n",
    "\n",

    "### **b. Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Browser automation frameworks** (e.g., Selenium)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Script a browser to simulate real user actions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. Deployment for Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Often done on **secondary system** parallel to production\n",
    "* Once stable → migrate to **production system**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Final testing phase where real users validate the system before public release.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **a. Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy **beta version** (pre-production)\n",
    "* Select **pilot group** of users:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Tolerant of occasional bugs\n",
    "  * Able to give detailed feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### **b. Feedback Expectations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not just “it doesn’t work” → but “this broke under these conditions”\n",
    "* Helps developers fix issues faster\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. Outcome**\n",
