    "# **Pytest – Modern Application Development**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction to pytest**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**:\n",
    "  Pytest is a Python framework for testing code, designed to make writing and running tests easier.\n",
    "  It works well for:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Small unit tests** (testing individual functions)\n",
    "  * **Larger functional/integration tests** (testing across multiple components)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Opinionated Framework**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pytest follows **specific conventions** and defaults for identifying tests.\n",
    "  * If you follow these conventions, pytest automatically discovers and runs tests without extra configuration.\n",
    "  * Advantage: Reduces misunderstandings between developers about how tests should be structured.\n",
    "  * Disadvantage: Some developers may dislike being forced into a particular style.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Automatic test discovery** (finds test files/functions without manual setup).\n",
    "  * **Test fixtures**: Setup and teardown logic that can be reused across multiple tests.\n",
    "  * **Monkeypatching** support: Temporarily altering code behavior for testing (not covered in detail here).\n",
    "  * **Easy failure reporting**: Shows exact mismatches between expected and actual values.\n",
    "  * Can handle **environment setup and teardown** for tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Comparison with `unittest`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Python's built-in testing framework is `unittest`.\n",
    "  * Pytest is an **alternative** with additional convenience features.\n",
    "  * Pytest can still run tests written in `unittest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Basic pytest Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1 – Simple Function Test\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# test_sample.py\n",
    "def func(x):\n",
    "    return x + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_answer():\n",
    "    assert func(3) == 5  # This will fail\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **func(x)** adds 1 to x.\n",
    "* Test function **`test_answer`** uses `assert` to check if `func(3)` equals 5.\n",
    "* Since `func(3)` returns `4`, test fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`assert`** in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If condition is `True`: test passes.\n",
    "  * If condition is `False`: raises `AssertionError`, test fails.\n",
    "* Pytest output shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Number of tests run\n",
    "  * Which tests failed\n",
    "  * Detailed mismatch between expected and actual output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Testing for Exceptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a function should **raise** an exception for invalid cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2 – Checking Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    raise SystemExit(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_mytest():\n",
    "    with pytest.raises(SystemExit):\n",
    "        f()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pytest.raises(ExceptionType)` ensures that running the given code **raises** the specified exception.\n",
    "* Useful for validating error-handling code (e.g., accessing an array out-of-bounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Temporary Files and Directories in pytest**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many tests require **temporary files/directories**.\n",
    "* Pytest can create them automatically and remove them after tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3 – Temp Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_needsfiles(tmpdir):\n",
    "    print(tmpdir)\n",
    "    assert 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`tmpdir`**: Special pytest fixture that creates a temp directory.\n",
    "* `assert 0` ensures test fails (for demonstration).\n",
    "* Output includes the generated temp directory path.\n",
    "* **Advantage**: Ensures test files don’t overwrite or delete existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Test Fixtures**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: A way to define setup and teardown logic **outside** of test functions.\n",
    "* Fixtures:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Prepare test data or environment before a test runs.\n",
    "  * Clean up after the test.\n",
    "  * Can be reused across multiple tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4 – Fixture for a List\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "@pytest.fixture\n",
    "def setup_list():\n",
    "    return [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_apple(setup_list):\n",
    "    assert \"apple\" in setup_list\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_banana(setup_list):\n",
    "    assert \"banana\" in setup_list\n",
    "\n",
    "def test_mango(setup_list):\n",
    "    assert \"mango\" in setup_list  # Will fail\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The fixture function `setup_list()` is decorated with `@pytest.fixture`.\n",
    "2. Tests declare a parameter named `setup_list`; pytest runs the fixture before the test and passes its return value.\n",
    "3. Each test gets its own fresh copy of the fixture data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoids duplicate setup code.\n",
    "* Changes in one test’s fixture data do not affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Pytest Test Discovery Conventions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytest automatically finds tests based on naming patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Test file names**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`\n",
    "* **Test function/method names**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Start with `test`\n",
    "* **Test classes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Class name starts with `Test`\n",
    "  * Methods inside start with `test`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Starts in **current directory** or from `testpaths` in config.\n",
    "* Recursively searches subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Testing Flask Applications with pytest**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.1. Client Fixture for Flask**\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask provides a `test_client()` that can simulate HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example – Client Fixture**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "import tempfile\n",
    "import pytest\n",
    "from flaskr import create_app, init_db\n",
    "\n",

    "    app = create_app({\n",
    "        'TESTING': True,\n",

    "    })\n",
    "\n",

    "    yield app.test_client()\n",
    "\n",
    "    os.close(db_fd)\n",
    "    os.unlink(db_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creates a **temporary SQLite database** for testing.\n",
    "* Sets `TESTING=True` to enable Flask’s testing mode.\n",
    "* `yield` returns the test client to the test function, then cleanup runs after the test.\n",
    "\n",
