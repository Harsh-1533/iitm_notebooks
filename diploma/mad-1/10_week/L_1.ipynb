    "Got it — this transcript is from the *Modern Application Development* course and covers the **introduction to testing** in software development.\n",
    "Here’s a **structured breakdown of the concepts discussed** so you can use it as clean notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction to Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why testing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Check if a system works **as intended**.\n",
    "  * Requirements/specifications define what “intended” means.\n",
    "  * Applies to all software development, not just web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Car**: Test fuel type compatibility, load capacity, speed limits, etc.\n",
    "* **Web App**: Test UI layout, input fields, correct page display, response to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions testing answers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does it work as intended?\n",
    "2. Does it respond correctly to inputs?\n",
    "3. Does it respond within reasonable time? (Important in time-critical systems like online exams.)\n",
    "4. Can it be installed properly and work in the intended environment?\n",
    "5. Is it **usable** and **correct**?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **2. Types of Testing Approaches**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Static Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* No program execution; only code inspection.\n",
    "* **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Code reviews** by experienced developers.\n",
    "  * **Formal proof checkers**.\n",
    "* Focus: Structure, correctness, maintainability.\n",
    "* **Limitation:** Does not verify actual runtime behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Dynamic Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Program is executed.\n",
    "* Apply inputs → check output.\n",
    "* Includes **valid inputs** and **invalid inputs** (corner cases).\n",
    "* Most common in real projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. White Box vs Black Box vs Grey Box**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **White Box Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tester knows internal code structure.\n",
    "* Can track variables, data structures, counters.\n",
    "* **Advantages:** Detailed debugging, can test hidden corner cases.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:** May focus on unimportant details, reduces abstraction between dev and tester.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Black Box Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tester only knows the **interfaces** (e.g., API endpoints, expected inputs/outputs).\n",
    "* No access to internal code.\n",
    "* **Advantages:** Closest to real-world usage, enforces clean separation.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:** Cannot easily debug internals, may miss certain edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Grey Box Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combination of both.\n",
    "* Test like black box, but inspect internals when needed.\n",
    "* Requires more knowledge and coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Regression Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensures **new changes don’t break existing functionality**.\n",
    "* **Regression**: A feature that was working stops working after an update.\n",
    "* Regression test suite:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Automates running old tests after each change.\n",
    "* Versioning (e.g., API V1 → V2) often used when breaking changes are unavoidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Code Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measures **how much of the code** is executed during tests.\n",
    "* **100% code coverage ≠ bug-free**.\n",
    "* Only means **each line ran at least once**.\n",
    "* Can’t guarantee all input variations or corner cases are tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Coverage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Coverage** – Every function is called at least once.\n",
    "2. **Statement Coverage** – Every line of code executes at least once.\n",
    "3. **Branch Coverage** – Every decision path (if/else) is taken at least once.\n",
    "4. **Condition Coverage** – Every condition within decisions is tested with true and false outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 100% branch coverage ≠ 100% condition coverage, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Example Code Discussion**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function `foo(x, y)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Tests needed to achieve:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Function coverage: At least one call to `foo`.\n",
    "    * Statement coverage: Ensure all lines execute.\n",
    "    * Branch coverage: Test both if-taken and if-skipped scenarios.\n",
    "    * Condition coverage: Test each condition in the `if` separately for true and false.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Summary Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requirements drive testing — they must be clear.\n",
    "* Designing effective tests is challenging.\n",
    "* Static + dynamic methods both important.\n",
    "* White, black, and grey box testing serve different purposes.\n",
    "* Regression testing is essential in iterative development.\n",
    "* Code coverage is a **useful metric** but **not proof of correctness**."
