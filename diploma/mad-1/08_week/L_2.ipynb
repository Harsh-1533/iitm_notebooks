    "# üß† Modern Application Development: Asynchronous Updates & DOM\n",
    "\n",
    "## üï∏Ô∏è 1. Evolution of Web Rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Original Web (Early 90s)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client-Server Interaction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Client sends request ‚Üí Server sends back complete HTML ‚Üí Browser renders.\n",
    "  * Every page interaction led to **full page reload**.\n",
    "* **Issues:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * No CSS initially ‚Üí Poor styling capabilities.\n",
    "  * Entire HTML sent again ‚Üí Redundant transfer (e.g., headers, footers repeated).\n",
    "  * **High network load**, not necessarily server load.\n",
    "  * **Slower User Experience (UX)** due to full-page reloads on every request.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Server-Side Rendering and Its Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 With the advent of CGI:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Server starts dynamically **assembling HTML pages** before sending.\n",
    "* Resulted in **more server work**.\n",
    "* Still led to **complete re-rendering** on the client side.\n",
    "* UX Impact: Entire screen refresh ‚Üí Slow and choppy experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö° 3. Asynchronous Updates: The Game Changer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Core Idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load main page quickly ‚Üí Then update part(s) of the page in the **background**.\n",
    "* Avoid full reloads. Only update necessary parts like content blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Faster initial load.\n",
    "* Improved **user experience**.\n",
    "* **Reduced network usage**, especially when many components are reused (e.g., navbars).\n",
    "* **Selective rendering**: Only necessary elements (e.g., `<div>`) get updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üê± 4. Example: Animal Information Page\n",
    "\n",
    "### Without Asynchronous Update:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Click a link ‚Üí Entire HTML reloads.\n",
    "* All components (header, navbar, footer) re-render.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Asynchronous Update:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Click on \"Cat\" ‚Üí Browser sends request for cat data only.\n",
    "* Server sends **structured data** (e.g., common name, Latin name, habitat).\n",
    "* Only the **targeted DOM section** updates.\n",
    "* **User perceives smooth, fast interaction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ∞Ô∏è 5. The Rise of AJAX\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AJAX** = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.\n",
    "* AJAX allowed **background data fetch** without reloading the page.\n",
    "* Response typically came in **XML** (nowadays: JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Send structured data from server to client.\n",
    "* JavaScript processes it to update DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üå≥ 6. DOM: Document Object Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 What is the DOM?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **tree-like abstract structure** representing the HTML page.\n",
    "* **Programming interface** to access/manipulate web documents.\n",
    "* Each element/tag is a **node** in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 DOM vs HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTML: Raw document.\n",
    "* DOM: In-memory representation of HTML ‚Üí Can be modified programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enables **partial updates** via JavaScript.\n",
    "* Avoids redrawing the whole page.\n",
    "* Provides a **structured, object-oriented API** for developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üíª 7. DOM + JavaScript: Practical Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Querying the DOM:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll(\"p\");\n",
    "alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName); // Shows \"P\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `document.querySelectorAll(\"p\")`: Gets all `<p>` elements.\n",
    "* Returns a **NodeList** (like an array).\n",
    "* `nodeName`: Returns tag name of the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß™ 8. DOM Manipulation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.1 JavaScript Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "window.onload = function() {\n",
    "  const heading = document.createElement(\"h1\");\n",
    "  const headingText = document.createTextNode(\"Big Head\");\n",
    "  heading.appendChild(headingText);\n",
    "  document.body.appendChild(heading);\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.2 What it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When the page loads**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Creates `<h1>Big Head</h1>`.\n",
    "  * Appends it to `<body>`.\n",
    "* Shows how JavaScript dynamically **injects content** into the DOM.\n",
    "* **No changes to the original HTML file** needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÇ 9. DOM + Programming Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9.1 Since DOM is a tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use standard programming techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Loops**\n",
    "  * **Conditions**\n",
    "  * **Object Composition**\n",
    "  * **Function Calls**\n",
    "* Makes web programming **powerful but complex**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ö†Ô∏è With great power comes great responsibility. Complex logic can hurt performance and readability if overused.\n",
