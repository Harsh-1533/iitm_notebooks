    "# L2.3: What is Markup?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Outcome:**  \n",
    "Understand how semantic meaning is added to raw content with the help of markup.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìÑ Content vs Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content** refers to the raw data or text (e.g., \"Chapter 1\", \"Welcome to our site\").\n",
    "- **Meaning** is the *structure*, *purpose*, or *role* that content plays (e.g., \"Chapter 1\" is a heading, \"Welcome to our site\" is a paragraph).\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† **Markup** adds **semantic meaning** to the content so computers and browsers can understand how to display or interpret it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h1>Welcome to Our Site</h1>\n",
    "<p>This is the home page of our website.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here, <h1> adds meaning: it shows the text is a main heading, and <p> means it is a paragraph.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß∑ Types of Markup\n",
    "1. Presentational Markup\n",
    "- Focuses on how the content looks (e.g., font size, bold).\n",
    "- Example: <b>Bold Text</b>, <i>Italic</i>\n",
    "- Not commonly used anymore for structure.\n",
    "2. Procedural Markup\n",
    "- Tells a program how to process or format the document.\n",
    "- Example: LaTeX commands in academic writing.\n",
    "3. Descriptive (Semantic) Markup\n",
    "- Describes the meaning of the content.\n",
    "- Example: \n",
    "```html \n",
    "<header>, <article>, <section> in HTML5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## üåê HTML: The Most Common Markup Language\n",
    "- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a semantic markup language used to structure web content.\n",
    "- It uses tags to mark elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, lists, images, etc.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <title>My Page</title>\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>\n",
    "    <p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Summary\n",
    "- Markup separates content from meaning.\n",
    "- It helps browsers and machines interpret content structure.\n",
    "- HTML is the most widely used markup language for the web."
