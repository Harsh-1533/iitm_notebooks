    "# Information Representation in a Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "- Computers **only work with bits**\n",
    "  - A **bit** is a binary digit: `0` or `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Numbers\n",
    "- **Binary Place Value**:  \n",
    "  - Similar to decimal, but base-2  \n",
    "  - Example: `6` in binary is `0110`\n",
    "- **Two’s Complement** (used for representing negative numbers):  \n",
    "  - Example: `-6` in 4-bit two's complement is `1010`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Letters and Text\n",
    "- Computers cannot \"understand\" letters directly.\n",
    "- Text is represented using **encoding systems**:\n",
    "  1. **ASCII**\n",
    "  2. **Unicode**\n",
    "  3. **UTF-8**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Information Interchange\n",
    "- Communication between machines (or humans and machines) is based on **bits**\n",
    "- **Standard encoding** ensures consistency\n",
    "  - Converts text/characters into machine-readable **binary sequences**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation of Bits\n",
    "- What does `0100 0001` represent?\n",
    "  - It’s a **string of bits**\n",
    "  - It equals the **decimal number 65**\n",
    "  - It represents the **character \"A\"** in ASCII\n",
    "  - ✅ **All of the above are correct**\n",
    "- Interpretation depends on:\n",
    "  - **Context**\n",
    "  - **How the system is set up to read those bits**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)\n",
    "- Uses **7 bits** → can encode **128 characters**\n",
    "- Includes:\n",
    "  - Uppercase letters: `'A'–'Z'`\n",
    "  - Lowercase letters: `'a'–'z'`\n",
    "  - Digits: `'0'–'9'`\n",
    "  - Special symbols: `! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ...`\n",
    "- Originally designed for **English-only text**\n",
    "- **Why 7 bits?**\n",
    "  - Saved memory in early computing systems\n",
    "- Limitation:\n",
    "  - Cannot represent characters from **non-English alphabets**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Unicode\n",
    "- Created to support text representation from **all languages and scripts**\n",
    "- Aims to encode:\n",
    "  - **All living languages**\n",
    "  - **All extinct languages**\n",
    "  - **All future languages**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unicode Variants\n",
    "- **UCS (Universal Character Set)**\n",
    "  - **UCS-2**:\n",
    "    - Uses **2 bytes** (16 bits) per character\n",
    "    - Can represent up to **65,536 characters**\n",
    "  - **UCS-4**:\n",
    "    - Uses **4 bytes** (32 bits) per character\n",
    "    - Can represent **4 billion+ characters**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bit)\n",
    "- A **variable-length encoding** for Unicode\n",
    "  - Uses **1 to 4 bytes** per character\n",
    "- **Backwards compatible** with ASCII\n",
    "- Widely used on the web and in modern systems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- **Bits** are the core representation in machines.\n",
    "- Meaning depends on **encoding** and **context**.\n",
    "- **ASCII** is simple and limited (English only).\n",
    "- **Unicode** is comprehensive (all scripts).\n",
    "- **UTF-8** is a practical and efficient encoding of Unicode."
