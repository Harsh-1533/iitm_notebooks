    "## âœ… Common Protocols:\n",
    "- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) â€“ Used for transferring web pages\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) â€“ For transferring files\n",
    "\n",
    "- TCP/IP â€“ Core communication protocols of the internet\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## âœ… Key HTTP Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method      | Purpose                                              |\n",
    "| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **GET**     | Requests data from the server (e.g., a web page)     |\n",

    "| **OPTIONS** | Shows allowed methods on a resource                  |\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all part of the stateless HTTP protocol (each request is independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "## ***âœ… Summary:***\n",
    "- Protocols define rules for communication between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP methods like GET and POST define what action a client wants."
