    "# üåê Introduction to Servers and HTTP Request-Response Cycle\n",
    "## ‚úÖ What is a Server?\n",
    "- A server is a computer or software system that provides data, services, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network, typically the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You (the client) request a page from a restaurant menu, and the server brings it to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples of servers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)\n",
    "\n",
    "- File server\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database server\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mail server\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÅ The HTTP Request-Response Cycle\n",
    "- When you open a website, your browser (the client) communicates with a web server using the HTTP protocol (HyperText Transfer Protocol).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let‚Äôs go step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **üß≠ Step 1: User Sends a Request (HTTP Request)**\n",
    "        - When you type a URL like https://example.com in your browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Your browser creates an HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Method (e.g., GET, POST)\n",
    "\n",
    "            - URL\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Headers (info like browser type, language, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Optional data (in case of forms, for example)\n",
    "    - **üåç Step 2: DNS Lookup**\n",
    "        - Before sending the request, your browser needs to find the IP address of example.com. It does this using the DNS (Domain Name System).\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - example.com ‚Üí 93.184.216.34\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **üö™ Step 3: Connecting to the Server**\n",
    "        - Once the IP is known, the browser opens a TCP connection to the server, usually on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **üì© Step 4: Server Receives Request**\n",
    "        - The server receives the HTTP request. Based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - the URL,\n",
    "\n",
    "            - the method (GET/POST),\n",
    "\n",
    "            - and other headers/data,\n",
    "\n",
    "        - ‚Ä¶it figures out what the client wants (like a web page, image, file, or form result).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **üß† Step 5: Server Processes the Request**\n",
    "        - Now the server does its job. This might involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Fetching data from a database\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Running some server-side code (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Generating HTML or JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "    - üì§ **Step 6: Server Sends Back HTTP Response**\n",
    "        - The server sends an HTTP response, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Headers (e.g., content-type)\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Body (actual data ‚Äî HTML, image, JSON, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **üñ•Ô∏è Step 7: Browser Renders the Page**\n",
    "        - The browser receives the response and:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Reads the HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Requests additional assets (CSS, JS, images)\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Renders the page you see on screen\n",
    "\n",
    "## ***‚úÖ Real-World Example***\n",
    "- You open: https://news.example.com/article/123\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Your browser sends a GET /article/123 request.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - DNS resolves the domain to an IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - TCP connection is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The server checks the article ID 123 in its database.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Server generates an HTML page with the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It sends back an HTTP response with the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Browser shows you the article.\n"
