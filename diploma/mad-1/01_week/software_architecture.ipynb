    "### 1. Model\n",
    "   - Represents the data and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Notifies the view when data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: A database of users or products.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. View\n",
    "   - Responsible for the user interface (UI).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Displays data from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: HTML pages, buttons, charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Controller\n",
    "   - Acts as a bridge between the View and the Model and business logic..\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Handles user input, processes it, and updates the model or view.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: When a user clicks ‚Äúsubmit,‚Äù the controller takes action.\n",
