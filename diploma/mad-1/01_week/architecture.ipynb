    "### **1. Client Server Model**\n",
    "- Explicit differentiation between clients and servers\n",
    "- Local systems:\n",
    "    - both client and server on same machine - local network / communication\n",
    "    - conceptually still a networked system\n",
    "- Machine clients\n",
    "    - eg. Software / antivirus updaters\n",
    "    - Need not have user interaction\n",
    "- Variants\n",
    "    - Multiple servers, single queue, multiple queues, load balancing frontends\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "    - Email\n",
    "    - Databases\n",
    "    - WhatsApp/messaging\n",
    "    - Web browsing\n",
    "### **2. Distributed (Peer-to-Peer) Model**\n",
    "- All peers are considered \"equivalent\"\n",
    "    - But some peers may be more equal than others...\n",
    "- Error tolerance\n",
    "    - Masters / introducers\n",
    "    - Election/re-selection of masters on failure\n",
    "- Shared information\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "    - Bittorrent\n",
    "    - Blockchain-based systems\n",
    "    - IPFS, Tahoe (distributed file systems)"

    "## ðŸ”µ **1. Client-Server Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Definition:\n",
    "- In Client-Server Architecture, there is:\n",
    "   - A server (central computer) that provides services or data.\n",
    "   - One or more clients (user computers or devices) that request and use those services.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ How it works:\n",
    "   - The client sends a request to the server.\n",
    "   - The server processes it and sends back the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Examples:\n",
    "   - Gmail (your phone or browser is the client, Googleâ€™s server handles email)\n",
    "   - Websites (browser = client, web server = server)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Features:\n",
    "   - Centralized control\n",
    "   - Easy to manage and secure\n",
    "   - Server can become a bottleneck (if overloaded)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”µ **2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Definition:\n",
    "- In Peer-to-Peer Architecture, each device (peer) acts as both a client and a server. There is no central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ How it works:\n",
    "   - Each peer can request and provide services to other peers.\n",
    "   - All peers are equal in terms of functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Examples:\n",
    "   - File sharing apps like BitTorrent\n",
    "   - Some multiplayer games\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Features:\n",
    "   - Decentralized system\n",
    "   - More scalable (adding peers increases power)\n",
    "   - Harder to manage and secure"
