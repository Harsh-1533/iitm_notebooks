    "## 1. Introduction to Custom Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Custom Elements?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HTML5 and Elements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * HTML5 defines a fixed set of elements (tags) like `<title>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<button>`, etc.\n",
    "  * Unlike XML, which allows arbitrary namespaces and custom tags, HTML5 restricts tags to predefined ones.\n",
    "* **Need for Custom Tags:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sometimes, developers want to define their own tags, e.g., `<my-button>`, `<flag-icon>`.\n",
    "  * These tags are not recognized by browsers natively.\n",
    "* **Challenge:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How should the browser interpret and render a custom tag like `<my-button>`?\n",
    "  * Does having the word \"button\" make it behave like a native button? No, it does not.\n",
    "  * The browser initially treats unknown tags as generic inline elements without special semantics or styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of JavaScript in Custom Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "* JavaScript solves the problem of defining how a custom element behaves and displays.\n",
    "* Custom elements have:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Display behavior:** How should the element render visually?\n",
    "  * **State management:** Elements can have internal state (e.g., checkbox checked/unchecked).\n",
    "  * **Event handling:** Custom elements can handle user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### States in Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although HTTP is stateless, UI elements can have local state.\n",
    "* Example: A checkbox or radio button’s checked state.\n",
    "* Custom elements may similarly have custom internal states that must be tracked and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Autonomous vs. Customized Built-in Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Autonomous custom elements:** Completely new tags unrelated to existing HTML elements (e.g., `<flag-icon>`).\n",
    "* **Customized built-in elements:** Extend or augment existing HTML tags with new functionality (e.g., extending `<p>` for a word count).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The HTML Living Standard and Custom Elements API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Living Standard Document\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **HTML Living Standard** is the continuously updated specification for HTML.\n",
    "* Section **4.13** defines **Custom Elements**.\n",
    "* The living standard is **non-normative** — subject to changes and updates over time.\n",
    "* It provides the official specification on how custom elements should be defined and function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Custom Elements in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "* You create a class extending `HTMLElement` or specific built-in element types.\n",
    "* Example: Define a class `FlagIcon` extending `HTMLElement`.\n",
    "* You define attributes, lifecycle callbacks (connectedCallback, disconnectedCallback, etc.), and rendering logic.\n",
    "* Use `customElements.define('flag-icon', FlagIcon)` to register the custom tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: `<flag-icon country=\"nl\"></flag-icon>`\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a human, this suggests displaying the flag of the Netherlands.\n",
    "* The JavaScript class would fetch and render the correct flag image.\n",
    "* The browser relies on this JavaScript definition to know how to handle the tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Web Components: Combining Multiple APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Custom Elements API allows creating new tags.\n",
    "* But to build reusable, encapsulated UI widgets, more tools are needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Style encapsulation (avoid leaking CSS styles).\n",
    "  * Template reuse (efficient HTML structure).\n",
    "* Web Components combine three key parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Custom Elements API** — define new elements.\n",
    "  2. **Shadow DOM API** — encapsulate styles and markup inside elements.\n",
    "  3. **HTML Templates** — reusable HTML fragments/templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Shadow DOM\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Shadow DOM?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shadow DOM creates a **separate DOM subtree** inside an element.\n",
    "* It **encapsulates** the element’s internal structure and styles, preventing external styles from leaking in or out.\n",
    "* Enables **scoped CSS**, so styles defined inside Shadow DOM apply only within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose you create a button inside Shadow DOM with a red background.\n",
    "* That style applies **only** to this button inside the Shadow DOM.\n",
    "* Other buttons outside the shadow root remain unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevents style collisions and unintended side-effects.\n",
    "* Makes components truly modular and self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. HTML Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of `<template>` and `<slot>`\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `<template>` tag holds inert HTML fragments — they don’t render directly.\n",
    "* You can clone and inject template content dynamically with JavaScript.\n",
    "* Useful for defining reusable markup structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Book List Template\n",
    "\n",
    "* A list of books with title and author.\n",
    "* Use different templates to display:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `\"Title - Author\"`\n",
    "  * `\"Author's classic novel, Title\"`\n",
    "* Switching templates dynamically changes the display format without rewriting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Examples of Custom Elements and Web Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Custom Element Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define a custom element `my-component`.\n",
    "* JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```js\n",
    "  class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {\n",
    "    constructor() {\n",
    "      super();\n",
    "      this.innerHTML = \"hello world\";\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  customElements.define('my-component', MyComponent);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* In HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```html\n",
    "  <my-component></my-component>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Result: Displays “hello world” where `<my-component>` is used.\n",
    "* Can be used multiple times for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word Count Component (Customized Built-in Element)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extends a native element, like `<p>`.\n",
    "* Counts words inside an editable article area.\n",
    "* Uses Shadow DOM to render the word count display.\n",
    "* Updates dynamically as user types.\n",
    "* Provides reusable widget for forms, editors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Benefits of Web Components\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reusability:** Components can be packaged and used across projects and websites.\n",
    "* **Encapsulation:** Internal implementation details are hidden, avoiding conflicts.\n",
    "* **Maintainability:** Changes to component internals do not affect outside code.\n",
    "* **Composability:** Components can be combined to build complex interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Limitations and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standardization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Custom Elements API is standardized.\n",
    "  * But usage of Shadow DOM, templates, and their integration vary.\n",
    "* **Browser support:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Modern browsers support these APIs well, but legacy browsers may lack support.\n",
    "* **Learning curve:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Understanding Shadow DOM and lifecycle callbacks is complex.\n",
    "* **Fragmentation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Different frameworks may implement or wrap web components differently.\n",
    "  * Lack of universal patterns for styling and templating.\n",
