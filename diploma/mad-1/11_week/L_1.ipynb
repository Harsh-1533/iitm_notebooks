    "This transcript is essentially giving a historical and conceptual overview of how HTML evolved, why \"Beyond HTML\" concepts matter for modern app development, and how different markup languages and standards (SGML, XML, XHTML, HTML5) fit into the bigger picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a **structured breakdown** of what was covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Context – “Beyond HTML”**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The lectures are meant to introduce concepts that are *not directly* needed for basic HTML/CSS, but are important for understanding **the next steps** in modern web development.\n",
    "* Applications are now **dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly**, which requires more than just HTML.\n",
    "* Focus is on **fundamental concepts** rather than teaching all frameworks.\n",
    "* Framework choices are subjective — developers often have strong personal preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Evolution of HTML – Why It Needed to Evolve**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HTML is not a programming language** — it’s a *markup language* for structuring content.\n",
    "* Early HTML lacked programming constructs like loops or conditionals.\n",
    "* Over time, developers wanted more interactivity, richer content, and stricter structuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Markup Languages – Before HTML**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Markup** means adding special tags or annotations to text to convey meaning to both humans and machines.\n",
    "* Originated in the **1960s**, initially for typesetting and document management.\n",
    "* Different target audiences → different needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Coders/programmers\n",
    "  * Publishers\n",
    "  * Academics (math, figures, columns)\n",
    "* Different output media (print, newspaper, brochures, electronic formats).\n",
    "* **Machine readability** was a key goal — markup should allow automated tools to interpret the document structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Meta-language for defining other markup languages.\n",
    "* Required a **Document Type Definition (DTD)** to specify allowed tags.\n",
    "* **Declarative** style: describe *what* you want, not *how* to do it.\n",
    "* **Rigorous** structure allowed complex, database-like documents.\n",
    "* Downsides: Too complex and hard to implement, leading to demand for simpler systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. HTML’s Relationship to SGML**\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTML was initially an **application of SGML**.\n",
    "* Designed by Tim Berners-Lee to be **lenient** — forgiving parsing for ease of authoring.\n",
    "* This leniency meant HTML often wasn’t valid SGML → tools that expected strict SGML would fail.\n",
    "* HTML 2.0 tried to improve compliance but had to support legacy pages.\n",
    "* HTML 4.0 came closer to SGML compliance, but backward compatibility remained a problem.\n",
    "* HTML5 later **broke away from SGML completely** with its own parsing rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. XML (Extensible Markup Language)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Derived from SGML but **simpler** and **more practical**.\n",
    "* Allows **custom tags** for different applications.\n",
    "* Human- and machine-readable.\n",
    "* Examples of XML in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **RSS feeds** (Really Simple Syndication)\n",
    "  * **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics)\n",
    "  * Office formats (.docx, .odt)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. XHTML**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reformulation of HTML 4 as an **XML application**.\n",
    "* Cleaner, modular, and interoperable with other XML systems.\n",
    "* Still had limitations due to XML strictness when adding new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. HTML5**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Created to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Support **modern web features** (video, audio, canvas).\n",
    "  * Be **easy to write** like HTML.\n",
    "  * Maintain **backward compatibility**.\n",
    "  * **Break away from SGML/XML**.\n",
    "  * Define its **own parser** with controlled leniency.\n",
    "* “Last version of HTML” → now a **Living Standard** maintained by WHATWG.\n",
    "* Updated continuously; compliance is measured “as of this date,” not by version number.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. Extending HTML – Custom Elements**\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTML5 allows new tags via **JavaScript** through the **Custom Elements API**.\n",
    "* Enables arbitrary functionality without changing the official HTML standard.\n",
    "* Risk: Search engines and tools may not understand custom semantics.\n",
    "* Bottom line: JavaScript becomes a **requirement** for extending HTML."
