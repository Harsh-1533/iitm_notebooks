    "## **Access Control – AppDev 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction to Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "Access control refers to the mechanisms and processes used to regulate who can access certain resources in a computer system or application, and what operations they can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Access** means the ability to **read, write, or modify** certain information.\n",
    "* Not all parts of an application are meant for public access — sensitive or private data must be protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example scenarios:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **E-commerce application** –\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Public access:** Product listings, general information.\n",
    "   * **Restricted access:** Customer’s phone number, email, address, and financial information.\n",
    "2. **Banking system** –\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Customers can access **only their own account information**.\n",
    "3. **Educational institutions** –\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Students can access **only their own grades**, not classmates’.\n",
    "4. **Company environment** –\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Different teams have access only to **their own departmental data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Types of Access**\n",
    "\n",
    "Access control isn’t only about modification; even read-only access needs to be regulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Read-only access:** User can view data but cannot change it.\n",
    "  Example: Viewing someone’s grades or a company’s confidential document.\n",
    "* **Read-write access:** User can view, create, modify, or delete data.\n",
    "  Example: Admin updating customer records.\n",
    "* **Fine-grained control:** Partial access to certain parts of a resource.\n",
    "  Example: A student can edit certain fields on a form but not delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Examples of Access Control in Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Linux File System**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Owner:** Creator of the file; can modify permissions.\n",
    "* **Group:** Group of users who can access a file.\n",
    "* **Root/Admin:** Has unrestricted access across the system.\n",
    "* File permissions determine who can **read (r)**, **write (w)**, and **execute (x)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Email Systems**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can read your own emails.\n",
    "* Forwarding emails is also a permission (can be restricted in certain systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **E-commerce**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shopping cart is visible only to the respective customer.\n",
    "* Financial information is strictly private.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Discretionary vs. Mandatory Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Owner of the resource controls who can access it.\n",
    "* Example: In Linux, file owner can set `chmod` permissions for others.\n",
    "* User has the discretion to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Allow others to read/write files.\n",
    "  * Revoke access at any time.\n",
    "* Example: Forwarding an email to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Access permissions are controlled by a **central authority**.\n",
    "* Users **cannot** transfer or change permissions on their own.\n",
    "* Highly restrictive, used in environments requiring high security:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Military systems\n",
    "  * Government classified data\n",
    "  * Sensitive corporate secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of granting permissions to individual usernames, permissions are tied to **roles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role:** A label representing a set of permissions.\n",
    "* Users are assigned roles, and roles control access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in a university:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Student** → Access to own grades.\n",
    "* **Teacher** → Access to grades of students they teach.\n",
    "* **Head of Department (HOD)** → Access to all departmental student records.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to manage when personnel change (update role assignment, not all individual permissions).\n",
    "* Supports **hierarchies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * HOD ⊇ Teacher ⊇ Student (HOD has all permissions of a teacher, plus more).\n",
    "* Roles can be unrelated (e.g., HOD and Sports Club Member are independent).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Adds **contextual attributes** to the decision-making process, beyond just roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples of Attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time of day:** Access allowed only between 9 AM – 5 PM.\n",
    "* **Location:** Access allowed only from within the office network.\n",
    "* **Device type:** Restrict access from unregistered devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A bank employee can view the ledger **only**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If they have the \"employee\" role **and**\n",
    "  * It is after 8 AM on a working day.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Permissions vs. Policies**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Permissions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple, static rules.\n",
    "* Example: \"User X can read File Y.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Policies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combine multiple conditions into rules.\n",
    "* Example: \"Employee can read ledger **if** it’s a working day **and** after 8 AM.\"\n",
    "* Policies allow more complex access logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Principle of Least Privilege**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Give each user or system process **only the minimum permissions necessary** to do their job.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Better security:** Fewer people can access sensitive data.\n",
    "* **Better stability:** Reduces risk of accidental changes.\n",
    "* **Ease of deployment:** Controlled, predictable environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linux users can read system libraries but cannot modify them.\n",
    "* `/etc/shadow` (stores encrypted passwords) readable only by root.\n",
    "* Python virtual environments allow local installs without altering system-wide files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some systems require loosening restrictions (e.g., writable directories for uploads in web apps).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Privilege Escalation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporarily gaining higher-level permissions for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **In Linux:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`sudo`**: Run a single command with elevated privileges.\n",
    "* **`su`**: Switch to another user (e.g., root) entirely.\n",
    "* **Risks:** Potential misuse or system damage; should be done minimally and logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Web Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Admin dashboards for special operations (adding users, modifying records).\n",
    "* Should only be accessed when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Enforcing Access Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "Access control can be implemented at multiple layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Hardware Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Physical security: keys, NFC cards, USB tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Operating System Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "* File permissions.\n",
    "* Memory segmentation (preventing one process from reading another’s memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Application Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Restrict routes/views based on user roles and permissions.\n",
    "* Implement checks in **controllers** before executing actions.\n",
    "* Use **decorators** in Python/Flask to wrap functions with access checks.\n",
