    "* **Goal**: Find the Minimum Cost Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected weighted graph.\n",
    "* **Approach**: Bottom-up. Start with all nodes as disjoint sets and connect them using the smallest-weight edge that doesn‚Äôt form a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kruskal's Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort all edges in increasing order of weight.\n",
    "2. Initialize all vertices as disjoint sets.\n",
    "3. For each edge (u, v) in sorted order:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If `Find(u) ‚â† Find(v)` ‚Üí they belong to different components:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Add edge to MST.\n",
    "     * `Union(u, v)` to merge the components.\n",

    "\n",
    "Efficiently keep track of which vertices are in which components (connected subgraphs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `MakeUnionFind(n)`\n",
    "   Initializes n singleton components.\n",
    "2. `Find(x)`\n",
    "   Returns the component name or ID to which x belongs.\n",
    "3. `Union(x, y)`\n",
    "   Merges components of x and y.\n",

    "### Component Mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use an array/dictionary: `component[i]` = name of component that contains vertex i.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Find(i)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Direct lookup: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Union(i, j)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let `c_old = component[i]`, `c_new = component[j]`\n",
    "* Scan all elements; for each element `k`, if `component[k] == c_old`, update to `c_new`\n",
    "* ‚è± Time Complexity: **O(n)** per union ‚Üí **O(m¬∑n)** for m edges (bad for large graphs)\n",

    "* `component[i]`: Which component vertex i belongs to.\n",
    "* `members[c]`: List of all vertices in component c.\n",
    "* `size[c]`: Number of vertices in component c.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improved Union(i, j):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rename smaller component into the larger one:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * if `size[c_old] ‚â§ size[c_new]`: move `c_old` ‚Üí `c_new`\n",
    "  * Else: move `c_new` ‚Üí `c_old`\n",
    "* Only iterate over `members[c_old]`, not all vertices.\n",
    "* Update:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `component[k] = c_new`\n",
    "  * `members[c_new].append(k)`\n",
