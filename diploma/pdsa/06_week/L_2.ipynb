    "## 🔧 **1. Motivation for Priority Queues**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Context**: We encountered performance issues in **Prim’s Algorithm** and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**.\n",
    "* The **main bottleneck**: At each step, we must choose the *next minimum-cost* vertex, which involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Scanning all unvisited vertices\n",
    "  * Finding the vertex with the smallest distance (or lowest cost edge)\n",
    "* If done naively, each selection is **O(n)** → leading to **O(n²)** total time.\n",

    "## 💡 **2. What is a Priority Queue?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **priority queue** is a **data structure** that maintains a collection of items, each with an associated *priority*.\n",

    "## 🔄 **3. Real-World Examples**\n",

    "* **Operating Systems**: Job schedulers prioritize tasks.\n",
    "* **Crowded Temple Analogy**: VIPs (high priority) can bypass regular queue order.\n",
