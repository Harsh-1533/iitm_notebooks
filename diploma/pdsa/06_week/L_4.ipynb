    "Here are **in-depth notes** based on the detailed explanation you shared, covering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Priority queues using heaps\n",
    "* Heap operations (insert, delete-min/max, update)\n",
    "* Dijkstra's algorithm with heaps\n",
    "* HeapSort\n",
    "* Prim's algorithm using heaps\n",

    "\n",
    "### âœ… 1. **Priority Queues and Heaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **priority queue** supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `insert(element)`\n",
    "  * `delete-max()` or `delete-min()` (based on highest or lowest priority)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Difference from normal queue**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Normal queue: FIFO (First In First Out)\n",
    "  * Priority queue: Always extracts item with **highest or lowest priority**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… 2. **Heaps for Efficient Priority Queues**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a **binary heap** to implement priority queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Supports `insert` and `delete-min/max` in **O(log n)** time\n",
    "  * Construction of a heap from `n` elements: **O(n)** time\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Heap is a complete binary tree** (filled left to right)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Can be stored in an array\n",
    "  * For a node at index `i`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Left child: `2i + 1`\n",
    "    * Right child: `2i + 2`\n",
    "    * Parent: `(i - 1) // 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… 3. **Heap Update Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ a. **Decrease a value** (e.g., 54 â†’ 35 in a min-heap)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Might violate heap property with **parent**\n",
    "* Bubble **up** toward the root if smaller than parent\n",
    "* Same process as insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ b. **Increase a value** (e.g., 29 â†’ 71)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Might violate heap property with **children**\n",
    "* Bubble **down** toward leaves\n",
    "* Same process as `delete-min` (heapify-down)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Time complexity for update: **O(log n)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… 4. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm with a Heap**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintain:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `visited` set\n",
    "  * `distance[]`: distances to unvisited nodes\n",
    "* At each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pick unvisited node with minimum distance\n",
    "  * Update distances of its neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Naive Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scan all unvisited nodes â†’ O(nÂ²)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ With Min Heap:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Insert all vertices with distances into a **min heap**\n",
    "* Use `delete-min` to pick vertex with minimum distance â†’ **O(log n)**\n",
    "* Update neighbor distances if shorter path found\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ New Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heap does not support efficient value updates (need to find and decrease a value)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Solution: **Extended Heap with Position Tracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain two mappings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `v_to_h[v]`: Heap position of vertex `v`\n",
    "* `h_to_v[h]`: Vertex at heap index `h`\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast lookup of vertex position in heap\n",
    "* Efficient updates (heapify up/down) with proper index adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `n log n` for extracting min `n` times\n",
    "* `m log n` for updating neighbors (across `m` edges)\n",
    "* **Total: O((m + n) log n)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… 5. **Primâ€™s Algorithm using Heap**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Same structure as Dijkstraâ€™s\n",
    "* Difference: Update with **minimum edge weight**, not cumulative distance\n",
    "* Replace `distance[u] + w` with just `w` when checking edges\n",
    "* Also runs in **O((m + n) log n)** with min heap + update support\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… 6. **HeapSort Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A heap is **partially ordered**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Max-heap â†’ max at root\n",
    "  * Min-heap â†’ min at root\n",
    "* Use it to **repeatedly extract max/min** and place at the correct position\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Build a heap from list â†’ O(n)\n",
    "2. Repeatedly do `delete-max` or `delete-min`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each `delete` takes O(log n)\n",
    "   * Do this `n` times â†’ O(n log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ In-place Sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* After extracting max, place it at the **end** of array\n",
    "* Shrink heap size and repeat\n",
    "* Avoids extra space unlike merge sort\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ”¹ Final HeapSort Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time: **O(n log n)**\n",
    "* Space: **In-place**\n",
    "* Comparison-based\n",
