    "## üìå 1. **Priority Queues: The Need for Heaps**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Priority Queue Definition**: A collection of items, each with a priority. You can:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `insert(item)`\n",
    "  * `delete_max()` ‚Üí remove and return the item with the highest priority.\n",
    "* **Naive Implementations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Sorted list**: Fast `delete_max`, slow `insert` ‚Üí O(n)\n",
    "  * **Unsorted list**: Fast `insert`, slow `delete_max` ‚Üí O(n)\n",
    "  * Total cost for n operations ‚Üí **O(n¬≤)**\n",
    "* **Grid-based improvement**: Using ‚àön √ó ‚àön grid gives total time **O(n‚àön)** for n ops.\n",
    "* **Goal**: Reduce both insert and delete\\_max to **O(log n)** ‚Üí use **binary trees**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üå≤ 2. **Binary Trees Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: A tree with each node having ‚â§ 2 children (left and right).\n",
    "* **Terminology**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Root**: Topmost node (no parent)\n",
    "  * **Child**: Node directly below another\n",
    "  * **Parent**: Node directly above\n",
    "  * **Leaf**: Node with no children\n",
    "  * **Size**: Total number of nodes\n",
    "  * **Height**: Number of levels (root is level 0)\n",

    "## üì¶ 3. **Heap Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **heap** is a special kind of binary tree with two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structural Property**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Must be **complete binary tree**: all levels filled **left to right**, only the last level can be incomplete.\n",
    "2. **Heap Order Property**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In a **max heap**: value at each node ‚â• values of its children.\n",
    "   * Root node always has the **maximum value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The maximum value is always at the **root**, so `delete_max` becomes efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÅ 4. **Insert Operation in Heap**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the new value in the next available position (left-to-right, level-order).\n",
    "2. **Bubble up** (or \"percolate up\") to restore heap order:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Compare with parent.\n",
    "   * Swap if current node > parent.\n",
    "   * Continue until heap property is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst-case time complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Proportional to the **height** of the tree ‚Üí **O(log n)**\n",
    "* Because the height of a complete binary tree with n nodes is **‚åälog‚ÇÇn‚åã**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üóëÔ∏è 5. **Delete Max Operation in Heap**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove the root (max value).\n",
    "2. Move the **last node** (bottom-rightmost) to the root.\n",
    "3. **Bubble down** (or \"heapify down\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Compare with its children.\n",
    "   * Swap with the **larger child** if it is smaller.\n",
    "   * Repeat until heap property is restored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Again **O(log n)**, because the fix path goes from root to leaf.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üßÆ 6. **Heap as an Array (List Representation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tree is stored in an array using level-order.\n",
    "* For a node at index `i`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Left child** ‚Üí `2i + 1`\n",
    "  * **Right child** ‚Üí `2i + 2`\n",
    "  * **Parent** ‚Üí `(i - 1) // 2`\n",

    "* Start with empty heap.\n",
    "* Insert elements one-by-one using heap insert.\n",
    "* **Time complexity**: O(n log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 2: **Efficient Heapify (Bottom-Up Fixing)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Treat it as a complete binary tree.\n",
    "  2. From the last internal node to the root, apply `heapify-down`.\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Leaf nodes already satisfy heap property.\n",
    "     * Fix from **bottom-up**, choosing the **bigger child** during swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's faster**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fewer operations at higher levels.\n",
    "* Although top nodes may need more swaps, there are fewer of them.\n",
    "* **Time complexity**: **O(n)**\n",

    "* A **min-heap** satisfies: each node ‚â§ children.\n",
    "* Used in **Dijkstra** and **Prim‚Äôs algorithms**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Need to repeatedly extract the **minimum** node.\n",
    "* Operations needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `insert()`\n",
    "  * `delete_min()` (similar to delete\\_max)\n",
    "  * **update()** ‚Üí Decrease the value of a node already in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to update elements already inside the heap (not covered in basic heap operations).\n",
    "* To solve Dijkstra/Prim efficiently, we must support **efficient update/decrease-key**.\n",

    "## ‚úÖ 10. **Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Heaps** offer a log-time solution to priority queue operations.\n",
    "* Efficient **array-based implementation** avoids using pointers or complex structures.\n",
    "* **Heapify in linear time** allows fast heap construction from an array.\n",
    "* **Min-heaps** are dual of max-heaps, required for algorithms like Dijkstra.\n",
    "* **Heaps do not yet solve Dijkstra completely**‚Äîwe also need an efficient **update** operation."
