    "### üß≠ **Introduction to Weighted Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **graph** consists of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges (connections)**.\n",
    "* A **weighted graph** assigns a **real number (cost/weight)** to each edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Represented by a weight function: `W(edge) ‚Üí ‚Ñù`\n",
    "  * Weights can be **positive, zero, or negative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç **Why BFS Doesn‚Äôt Work for Weighted Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BFS** finds the shortest path **in terms of number of edges** (unweighted).\n",
    "* In weighted graphs, the **shortest number of edges** may not mean **minimum total cost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: Direct edge (0 ‚Üí 2) = 80\n",
    "    But going via 1 (0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2) = 10 + 6 = 16 ‚Üí cheaper.\n",

    "\n",
    "### üì¶ **Representation of Weighted Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adjacency Matrix**:\n",
    "  Use a pair per cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `(has_edge, weight)` ‚Üí e.g., `matrix[i][j] = (1, 10)`\n",
    "  * If no edge ‚Üí `(0, 0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adjacency List**:\n",
    "  Store `(vertex, weight)` pairs for each neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: Node 1 ‚Üí `[(0,10), (2,6), (4,20)]`\n",

    "### üéØ **Shortest Path Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goal: **Minimize total cost** from source to destination.\n",
    "* **Path length** = Sum of weights along the path (not number of edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß© **Two Main Types of Shortest Path Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * From a **fixed source** vertex to **all others**.\n",
    "   * Real-world: Package routing from warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Find shortest path **between every pair** of vertices.\n",
    "   * Real-world: Travel websites, maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Negative Edge Weights**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **negative edge** might represent profit (e.g., busy road brings income).\n",
    "* **Danger**: **Negative-weight cycles**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: Cycle with total cost < 0 ‚Üí cost can be decreased infinitely.\n",
    "  * In this case, **shortest path is undefined**.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Allowed**: Negative edges **without** negative cycles.\n",
    "‚ùå **Not Allowed**: Negative **cycles** ‚Üí leads to infinite optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "### üßµ **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weighted graphs require specialized algorithms for shortest paths.\n",
    "* **Total path cost** = sum of weights along the path.\n",
    "* Represented using **adjacency matrix or list**, storing weights.\n",
    "* Key problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **SSSP** (e.g., Dijkstra‚Äôs, Bellman-Ford)\n",
    "  * **APSP** (e.g., Floyd-Warshall)\n",
    "* **Negative weights** need careful handling (esp. cycles).\n",
