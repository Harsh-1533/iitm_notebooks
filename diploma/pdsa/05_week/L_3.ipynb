    "# Single Source Shortest Paths with Negative Weights (Bellman-Ford Algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dijkstra's algorithm **fails with negative edge weights** because it assumes once a shortest distance to a node is found, it cannot be improved.\n",
    "* Negative weights can cause a shorter path to be found **after** a node is processed.\n",
    "* **Bellman-Ford** algorithm handles such cases by **not freezing** any decision and **continually updating** distances over multiple iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚖️ When Dijkstra's Algorithm Fails\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Dijkstra, once a vertex is marked as processed (visited), its distance is assumed final.\n",
    "* But if there are **negative edge weights**, a **better path might be discovered later**, violating the assumption.\n",
    "* Thus, Dijkstra requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Graph must have **non-negative weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❌ The Issue with Negative Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consider a case:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  u --5--> v --(-3)--> w\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Dijkstra will process `u` to `v`, but miss that `u -> v -> w` is better than another route.\n",
    "* The root issue: **Dijkstra makes greedy, irreversible decisions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏛️ Bellman-Ford Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows **distance updates even after a vertex is processed**.\n",
    "* **Iteratively improves estimates** of shortest paths.\n",
    "* Works in **both directed and undirected** graphs.\n",
    "* Does **not freeze decisions**; keeps checking for better paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Edge weights can be **negative**, but **no negative weight cycles** allowed.\n",
    "* If there's a **negative cycle**, shortest paths are undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✍️ Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shortest path from source `s` to any vertex `v` has **at most (n - 1) edges**.\n",
    "* Why? A path longer than `n-1` edges must repeat a vertex → forms a cycle.\n",
    "* So, **after (n - 1) passes**, all shortest paths are guaranteed to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(n - 1):  # Do this n-1 times\n",
    "    for each edge (u, v) with weight w:\n",
    "        if dist[u] + w < dist[v]:\n",
    "            dist[v] = dist[u] + w\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This process finds shortest paths of increasing lengths.\n",
    "* On the `i-th` iteration, we finalize all shortest paths that use up to `i` edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 Why It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose shortest path to vertex `v` uses `l` edges.\n",
    "* Before discovering this path, we must have finalized shortest paths to all vertices on that path using `< l` edges.\n",
    "* Bellman-Ford naturally uncovers shortest paths in increasing order of edge-length.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔒 Negative Cycle Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "* After performing `n - 1` iterations, perform **one extra iteration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If **any distance changes**, a **negative weight cycle exists**.\n",
