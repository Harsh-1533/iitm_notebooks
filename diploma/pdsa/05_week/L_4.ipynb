    "# All Pairs Shortest Paths - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ú® Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* In some scenarios, you need the shortest path **between all pairs** of vertices, not just from a single source.\n",
    "* **Dijkstra** and **Bellman-Ford** handle **single-source** shortest paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Dijkstra: Fast, but **only** for **non-negative weights**.\n",
    "  * Bellman-Ford: Works with **negative weights**, but **slower**.\n",
    "* If you run these algorithms for **every vertex as source**, you get all-pairs shortest paths, but it's inefficient.\n",
    "* We seek a more **direct and efficient method**: the **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öñÔ∏è Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a graph with `n` vertices (numbered 0 to n-1) and edge weights (positive or negative, but **no negative cycles**), compute the **shortest distance between every pair (i, j)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîé Intuition from Transitive Closure\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **transitive closure**, we determine whether there's a **path** (of any length) between vertex `i` and vertex `j`.\n",
    "* Floyd-Warshall adapts this concept to compute the **shortest path length** instead of just reachability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úèÔ∏è Key Idea (Dynamic Programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SP_k[i][j]` be the shortest distance from `i` to `j` using **only** intermediate vertices from the set `{0, 1, ..., k-1}`.\n",
    "* Base case (`k = 0`): only **direct edges** allowed.\n",
    "* Transition:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  SP_k[i][j] = min(SP_{k-1}[i][j], SP_{k-1}[i][k-1] + SP_{k-1}[k-1][j])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Let `dist[i][j] = weight of edge (i, j)` if it exists, else `inf`.\n",
    "   * `dist[i][i] = 0` for all `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Main Loop**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for k in range(n):\n",
    "       for i in range(n):\n",
    "           for j in range(n):\n",
    "               if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]:\n",
    "                   dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **After loop ends**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `dist[i][j]` contains the length of the shortest path from `i` to `j`.\n",
    "   * If any `dist[i][i] < 0`, a **negative weight cycle** exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Naively: $O(n^3)$ for all `SP_k[i][j]`\n",
