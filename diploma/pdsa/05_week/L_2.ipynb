    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Problem Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a **weighted graph** with **non-negative edge weights**, compute the **shortest path** from a **single source node** `s` to **all other vertices**.\n",
    "* Each edge has a cost/weight representing distance, time, or any other metric.\n",
    "* Goal: Minimize **total weight**, not number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔥 **Intuition via \"Fire Analogy\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imagine fire spreading from vertex `0` through **pipelines** (edges) at a **uniform speed**.\n",
    "* The time at which each vertex “burns” corresponds to the **shortest distance** from the source.\n",
    "* The fire reaches a vertex `v` by the **minimum total cost path** from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a **greedy strategy**: always process the unvisited node with the **smallest known distance** next.\n",
    "* Once a node is \"burned\" (processed), its shortest path distance is **final** and **never changes**.\n",
    "* Think in terms of **distance estimates** for each node:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Initially, all are ∞ (infinity)\n",
    "  * Distance to the source is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Why No Negative Weights?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a **negative edge** exists, a **future shorter path** might appear **after** we’ve committed to a node — violating the greedy property.\n",
    "* Dijkstra’s correctness depends on the fact that **taking the best choice now leads to the best result later**, which fails with negative weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **Algorithm Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `distance[source] = 0`\n",
    "   * `distance[other_nodes] = ∞`\n",
    "   * `visited[v] = False` for all `v`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Repeat until all nodes are visited:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Choose the **unvisited node `u`** with the **smallest `distance[u]`**\n",
    "   * Mark `u` as visited\n",
    "   * For each unvisited neighbor `v` of `u`, update:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     distance[v] = min(distance[v], distance[u] + weight(u, v))\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Adjacency Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loop runs `n` times\n",
    "* Each iteration:\n",

    "  * Find next min-distance unvisited node → `O(n)`\n",
    "  * Update neighbors → `O(n)`\n",
    "* **Time complexity**: `O(n²)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Adjacency List**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neighbor updates now take time proportional to node's **degree** instead of all `n` columns.\n",
    "* Still need `O(n)` time to find min-distance unvisited node.\n",
    "* **Time complexity**: `O(n²)` (until we use a min-priority queue → see below)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Handling Infinity in Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "* True ∞ can't be used in most programming languages.\n",
    "* Use a **large constant**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  infinity = (max edge weight) × (number of vertices) + 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Ensures any real path cost is less than this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Greedy Justification**\n",
    "\n",
    "* At each step, choose node `v` with the smallest **expected burn time (distance)**.\n",
    "* We assume all previously processed (burned) nodes have **correct shortest paths**.\n",
    "* Greedily selecting `v` is correct **only if no shorter path appears later** — which is guaranteed if **all edge weights ≥ 0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 **Bottleneck and Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problem: Finding the **minimum distance unvisited node** takes `O(n)` time in each iteration.\n",
    "* Optimization: Use a **min-heap (priority queue)** to extract the min in `O(log n)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This improves total time to `O((n + m) log n)` using a **priority queue + adjacency list** (where `m = number of edges`).\n",
