    "### üå≥ Minimum Cost Spanning Trees (MCST) ‚Äî In Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Minimum Cost Spanning Tree (MCST)** is a fundamental concept in **graph theory**, particularly useful in **network design**, such as laying cables, road construction, or telecommunication paths with **minimum cost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ What Is a Spanning Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a **connected**, **undirected** graph $G = (V, E)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **spanning tree** is a **subset of edges** $T \\subseteq E$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * All **vertices are connected** (no vertex is isolated)\n",
    "  * There are **no cycles**\n",
    "  * It contains exactly $|V| - 1$ edges\n",
    "\n",
    "üîÅ Every connected graph has at least one spanning tree.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ What Makes a Spanning Tree ‚ÄúMinimum Cost‚Äù?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If each edge has a **weight (cost)**, the **total weight** of a spanning tree is the sum of the weights of the selected edges.\n",
    "* A **Minimum Cost Spanning Tree (MCST)** is the spanning tree with the **smallest total weight** among all possible spanning trees.\n",

    "1. A graph with **$V$ vertices** will have **$V - 1$** edges in its MST.\n",
    "2. **Unique edge weights ‚áí Unique MST**\n",
    "3. **Cycle Property**: In any cycle, the **heaviest edge** cannot be in the MST.\n",
    "4. **Cut Property**: For any cut (partition of vertices into two sets), the **lightest edge crossing the cut** is in the MST.\n",
