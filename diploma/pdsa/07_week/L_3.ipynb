    "### 1. **No Idle Time in Optimal Schedule**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any idle time can be ‚Äúcompressed‚Äù without increasing lateness.\n",
    "* Moving jobs earlier keeps or reduces lateness.\n",
    "* So, always assume optimal schedule has no gaps.\n",

    "### 2. **Greedy Schedule = No Inversions**\n",
    "\n",
    "> An **inversion** occurs if a job `i` appears before job `j`, but `D·µ¢ > D‚±º`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Greedy schedule: sorted by `D·µ¢`, so **no inversions** possible\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ† Exchange Argument\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert **any optimal schedule** into **greedy schedule** using **local swaps** that don‚Äôt increase lateness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with any **optimal schedule** `O`, assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * All jobs are scheduled\n",
    "   * No idle time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **If O has an inversion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * There exist jobs `i` and `j` where:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * `i` comes before `j` in `O`\n",
    "     * but `D·µ¢ > D‚±º` (inversion)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify the **first inversion**: it must be between two **adjacent jobs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Swap i and j** to fix the inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The **lateness of j** gets better (finishes earlier)\n",
    "   * The **lateness of i** increases, but not more than the lateness of j before the swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "   So:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\max(L_i, L_j) \\text{ remains same or decreases}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Repeat for all inversions. After at most `n(n-1)/2` swaps, no inversions remain ‚áí we get the greedy order.\n",

    "## üßæ Handling Equal Deadlines\n",
    "\n",
    "* If multiple jobs have the **same deadline**, any permutation of them is valid.\n",
    "* Greedy schedule picks some arbitrary order.\n",
    "* Optimal schedule might differ, but **lateness stays the same** since the total block duration is unchanged.\n",
