    "## ‚úÖ **Why This Works (Proof Sketch):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `A = Greedy solution` (using earliest finish strategy)\n",
    "* `O = Optimal solution` (maximum possible non-overlapping intervals)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Greedy selects intervals `i1, i2, ..., ik`\n",
    "* Optimal selects intervals `j1, j2, ..., jm`\n",
    "\n",
    "Claim: **k = m** ‚áí greedy is optimal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy of the Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sort both `A` and `O` by finishing times\n",
    "* Show that for all `l`: `finish(il) ‚â§ finish(jl)` (i.e., greedy is always ‚Äúahead‚Äù or ‚Äúequal‚Äù)\n",
    "* By induction:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Base case (l = 1): Greedy always picks the globally earliest finish ‚áí holds\n",
    "  * Inductive step: If `finish(il-1) ‚â§ finish(jl-1)` then due to ordering, greedy has access to `jl` and will prefer an equal or earlier finishing job ‚áí holds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Argument (Proof by Contradiction):\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume greedy chose fewer jobs: `k < m`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the `(k+1)`-th job in `O` (i.e., `j(k+1)`) must be compatible with jobs in greedy set `A` (since `finish(ik) ‚â§ start(j(k+1))`), but greedy would have picked it if it were compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contradiction implies `k = m`.\n",
