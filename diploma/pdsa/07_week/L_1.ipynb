    "## ðŸ“Œ 1. **Motivation for Balanced Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic Data Requirement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We need efficient insertion, deletion, and searching in data that changes over time.\n",
    "* **Problem with Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Operations (insert, delete, find) are **O(h)** where `h = height of the tree`.\n",
    "  * In worst-case, a BST becomes skewed (like a linked list) â‡’ `h = n`, so operations become **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ’¡ Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure tree height is **logarithmic (O(log n))**, so each operation remains efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ 2. **Defining Balance in a Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Two Quantitative Measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Size**: Total number of nodes.\n",
    "* **Height**: Length of longest path from root to any leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Perfect Balance via Size:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Equal size left and right subtrees at every node.\n",
    "* Results in **complete binary trees**: Fully filled except possibly the last level.\n",
    "* Limitation: Too rigid for dynamic insertions/deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Practical Balance via Height:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AVL Trees**: Trees where, for every node:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  | height(left subtree) - height(right subtree) | â‰¤ 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Named after **Adelson-Velskii** and **Landis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ 3. **Height vs. Size â€“ Justification for O(log n)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prove that in AVL trees:\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    S(h) = 1 + S(h-1) + S(h-2)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Base: `S(0) = 0`, `S(1) = 1`\n",
    "* This recurrence is similar to **Fibonacci numbers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  S(h) â‰¥ F(h)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Fibonacci numbers grow **exponentially** â‡’\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  h = O(log n)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Hence, AVL trees ensure **logarithmic height**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ 4. **Slope of a Node**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  slope = height(left) - height(right)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* **AVL Property**: Slope âˆˆ {â€“1, 0, +1}\n",
    "* If slope becomes Â±2 â‡’ imbalance needs correction.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Œ 5. **Causes of Imbalance**\n",
