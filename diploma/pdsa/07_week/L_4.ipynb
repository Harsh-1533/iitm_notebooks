    "## 🧩 1. Introduction to Huffman Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✉️ Problem Context: Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "* We send messages in a language (e.g., English, Hindi).\n",
    "* Internally, communication is digital → data transmitted as binary (0s and 1s).\n",
    "* Every **symbol/letter** needs to be **encoded** into binary before transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📏 Standard Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "* For 26 letters (A–Z), we need at least 5 bits because $2^4 = 16 < 26 < 32 = 2^5$.\n",
    "* Fixed-length encoding (5 bits per letter) is simple but inefficient.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## ⚡ 2. Motivation for Huffman Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Some letters occur more frequently than others.**\n",
    "* Example from Scrabble: 'E' is common, 'Q' and 'Z' are rare.\n",
    "* Idea: Use **shorter codes for frequent letters** and **longer codes for rare ones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚫 Limitation of Variable-Length Coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable-length codes can be **ambiguous**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * E.g., code string `0101` can be decoded in multiple ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ 3. Prefix Codes – The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔐 Prefix-Free Code\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of codes is **prefix-free** if **no code is a prefix of another**.\n",
    "* This ensures **unambiguous decoding**.\n",
    "* Example: Morse code is not prefix-free (e.g., 'E' = dot, 'A' = dot-dash).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A prefix code is a variable-length encoding where no code is a prefix of any other code.\n",

    "\n",
    "Construct a **prefix-free encoding** that **minimizes average number of bits per letter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Frequency-Based Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate frequency $f(x)$ of each letter from a large corpus.\n",
    "* Encode using binary strings of variable length $E(x)$, such that the **average bits per letter** is minimized:\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Binary Tree**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Symbols are at **leaves**.\n",
    "  * Left edge = 0, Right edge = 1 (or vice versa).\n",
    "  * Encoding of a symbol is the **path from root to leaf**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ Tree Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full binary tree**: Each node has 0 or 2 children.\n",
    "2. **Higher frequency = closer to root**.\n",

    "## 🔁 7. Huffman Tree Construction (Greedy)\n",

    "### 💡 Greedy Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick 2 symbols with **lowest frequency**.\n",
    "2. Combine them into a new **composite symbol** with sum frequency.\n",
    "3. Repeat until only 2 symbols remain.\n",
    "4. Build tree **bottom-up**, expand composite nodes back into original symbols.\n",

    "### 🎓 Inductive Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Base case: For 2 symbols → assign codes 0 and 1 → trivially optimal.\n",
    "* Inductive step:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Combine least frequent x and y to form x+y.\n",
    "  * Build optimal code for new alphabet (k−1 size).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 10. Why is it Greedy?\n",
    "\n",
    "* At every step, **locally** choose the two smallest frequencies to combine.\n",
    "* Never backtrack or revise this choice.\n",
