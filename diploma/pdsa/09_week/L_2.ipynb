    "### ‚úÖ Motivation Behind Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many problems have **inductive (recursive) structure**, meaning they are defined in terms of **smaller subproblems**.\n",
    "* If not handled carefully, **repeated subproblems** will be recomputed multiple times.\n",
    "* This **wasteful re-computation** leads to inefficiency, particularly in exponential-time recursive algorithms like naive Fibonacci.\n",
    "* Solution: **Avoid solving the same subproblem multiple times** using:\n",

    "## üåÄ Recursive Structure and Redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Inductive Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Factorial**:\n",
    "  `factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)`\n",
    "* **Insertion Sort**:\n",
    "  Sorts a list by recursively sorting the sublist and inserting the current element.\n",
    "* **Fibonacci**:\n",
    "  `fib(0) = 0, fib(1) = 1`\n",
    "  `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)` for n > 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When using recursive functions (e.g., for `fib(5)`), the function will recompute the **same subproblems** multiple times:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `fib(3)` is computed more than once\n",
    "  * `fib(2)` is computed even more frequently\n",
    "* This leads to **exponential growth** in calls ‚Äî e.g., computing `fib(50)` will take a very long time with naive recursion.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üí° Memoization: The Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoization = **‚ÄúMemo‚Äù (reminder) + ‚Äú-ization‚Äù**\n",
    "A technique to **store results of expensive function calls** and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid repeated computation.\n",
    "* Optimize recursive algorithms by **storing previously computed results** in a lookup structure like a **dictionary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On receiving a recursive call:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Check** if result exists in the memo (dictionary).\n",
    "\n",
    "     * ‚úÖ If yes: **Return** the value from the table.\n",
    "     * ‚ùå If no: **Compute recursively**, **store** in the table, then return it.\n",
    "2. Ensures each subproblem is solved **only once**.\n",
