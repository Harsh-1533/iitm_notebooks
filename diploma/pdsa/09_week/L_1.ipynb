    "# üìò Lecture 9.1 ‚Äì Dynamic Programming (DP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course**: Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using Python (PDSA)\n",
    "**Main Goal**: Introduce the motivation and foundation for dynamic programming through recursive problems and optimal substructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ 1. **Background: Inductive Definitions & Recursive Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚û§ Inductive Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example: Factorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Base case: `fact(0) = 1`\n",
    "  * Recursive case: `fact(n) = n √ó fact(n-1)`\n",
    "* **Example: Insertion Sort**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Base case: `insertion_sort([]) = []`\n",
    "  * Recursive case:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Sort the first `n` elements.\n",
    "    * Insert the last element into the sorted list using an `insert()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚û§ Recursive Functions Naturally Follow from Inductive Definitions\n",

    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  def factorial(n):\n",
    "      if n <= 0:\n",
    "          return 1\n",

    "## üîç 2. **Recursive Structure = Subproblems**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Idea**: Recursion breaks down problems into smaller **subproblems** and combines their solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚û§ Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Factorial**: Solving `factorial(n)` requires solving `factorial(n-1)`, ..., down to `factorial(0)`.\n",
    "* **Insertion Sort**: To sort `X‚ÇÄ to X‚Çô`, first sort `X‚ÇÄ to X‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ`, then insert `X‚Çô`.\n",

    "### ‚û§ Interval Scheduling Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Given**: A list of jobs/requests, each with a fixed start and end time.\n",
    "* **Goal**: Maximize number of **non-overlapping** intervals.\n",
    "* **Greedy Strategy**: Always pick the job that finishes earliest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚û§ Optimal Substructure Exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choosing one job splits the timeline and creates a smaller subproblem (remaining jobs that don't overlap).\n",
    "* Greedy algorithms work *only when we can prove* that the greedy choice leads to an optimal solution (e.g., via exchange arguments).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí∞ 4. **Weighted Interval Scheduling (Motivation for DP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Modified Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each job has:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `start_time`, `end_time`, and `weight` (e.g., revenue or importance).\n",
    "* **Goal**: Maximize total **weight** of non-overlapping jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Greedy Fails:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Picking earliest finishing job doesn't always yield max weight.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Job A: weight 1, ends early\n",
    "  Job B: weight 1, overlaps with A\n",
    "  Job C: weight 3, overlaps with both A and B\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Greedy chooses A and B ‚Üí weight = 2\n",
    "  * Optimal: pick only C ‚Üí weight = 3\n",

    "## üß± 5. **Exhaustive Recursive Strategy (Building Towards DP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚û§ Recursive Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort jobs by start time: B‚ÇÅ, B‚ÇÇ, ..., B‚Çô.\n",
    "2. At each step, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Include** job Bi:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Skip overlapping jobs (e.g., B‚ÇÇ and B‚ÇÉ if they conflict with B‚ÇÅ)\n",
    "     * Add Bi's weight + solve remaining compatible jobs.\n",
    "   * **Exclude** job Bi:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Move to next job.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚û§ Recurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let `OPT(i)` be the maximum weight achievable from jobs i to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "OPT(i) = max(\n",

    "\n",
    "* Same subproblem (e.g., jobs B‚ÇÉ to B‚Çô) might be recomputed multiple times from different recursive branches.\n",
    "* Leads to **exponential time complexity**.\n",

    "Avoid **recomputing** overlapping subproblems by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memoization (Top-Down)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use a dictionary or array to store results of solved subproblems.\n",
    "   * Before solving, check if the result is already computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Solve subproblems iteratively in an order that ensures dependencies are already computed.\n",
    "   * Typically uses a DP array/table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## üß† 7. **Why DP is Powerful**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recursive structure (like factorial, insertion sort, scheduling) suggests **optimal substructure**.\n",
    "* But overlapping subproblems make naive recursion inefficient.\n",
