    "You are given a **sequence of matrices**, and you want to compute their **product** with **minimum number of scalar multiplications**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are **not** changing the order of matrices. That is, you're computing `M0 x M1 x M2 x ... x Mn-1` as given.\n",
    "* But since matrix multiplication is **associative**, you can choose how to parenthesize the product.\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, to compute `A √ó B`, we do `m √ó n √ó p` scalar multiplications.\n",

    "* `C[i][j]` = Minimum cost of multiplying matrices from `Mi` to `Mj` (inclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üü¶ Base Case:\n",
