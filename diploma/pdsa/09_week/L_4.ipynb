    "## üî∏ Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic introduces two classic problems on strings that are solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Longest Common Subword (LCW)** ‚Äì a contiguous matching segment in two strings.\n",
    "2. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** ‚Äì a non-contiguous, but ordered matching sequence in two strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems demonstrate the use of **memoization**, **inductive substructure**, and **efficient DP table-filling strategies**.\n",

    "## üîπ 1. Longest Common Subword (LCW)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `u` and `v`, find the **longest contiguous substring (segment)** present in both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `u = \"bisect\"`, `v = \"secret\"`\n",
    "* Common subwords: `\"sec\"` ‚Üí length = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Brute-force Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each pair of positions `i` in `u` and `j` in `v`, check how long the matching segment is.\n",
    "* Continue comparing `u[i+k]` with `v[j+k]` until characters differ.\n",
    "* Time complexity: **O(m √ó n √ó min(m, n))** in worst case.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Time: **O(m √ó n)**\n",
    "* Space: **O(m √ó n)** (can optimize to O(n) with rolling arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üßµ Recovering the Subword\n",
    "\n",
    "* After computing the DP table, backtrack from the cell with the max value along the diagonal to get the subword.\n",
