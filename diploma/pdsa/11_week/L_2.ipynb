    "\n",
    "* **Linear constraints**: All constraints are expressed as **linear functions** of decision variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * No products of variables (e.g., $x_1 \\times x_2$ not allowed).\n",
    "  * No powers of variables (e.g., $x_i^2$ not allowed).\n",
    "  * Each term: **coefficient × variable**.\n",
    "* **Objective function**: Another linear function of the decision variables, which we either:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Maximize** (e.g., profit)\n",
    "  * **Minimize** (e.g., cost)\n",
    "* **Feasible region**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Intersection of all constraints.\n",
    "  * Forms a **convex region** in the solution space.\n",
    "* **Key property**:\n",
    "  If the feasible region is non-empty, the **optimum is guaranteed to be at one of the vertices** of the feasible region.\n",
    "* **Simplex method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Starts at some vertex.\n",
    "  * Moves to a **neighboring vertex** if it improves the objective.\n",
    "  * Stops when no improvement is possible.\n",
    "  * Greedy in nature but works for LP.\n",
    "  * Worst-case complexity: exponential; however, efficient polynomial algorithms also exist.\n",

    "## 2. **LP Duality**\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the original LP (the **primal**), we can derive a **dual problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Multiply constraints by constants (new variables = multipliers).\n",
    "  * New variables must be **non-negative** (≥ 0).\n",
    "  * Solving the dual provides a solution to the primal.\n",
    "* Duality is powerful for:\n",

    "  * Alternative interpretations of the problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Company**: Makes hand-woven carpets.\n",
    "* **Initial workforce**: 30 employees.\n",
    "* **Normal production**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Each employee produces 20 carpets/month.\n",
    "  * Salary = ₹20,000 per month.\n",
    "  * Labour cost per carpet = ₹1,000.\n",
    "* **Demand**: Known for each month (12 months).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Sometimes below capacity (600 carpets).\n",
    "  * Sometimes above capacity.\n",
    "* **Goal**: Match production to monthly demand exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Options for Meeting Demand**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: **Overtime**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pay **80% extra** for overtime carpets.\n",
    "* Overtime carpet cost = ₹1,800.\n",
    "* Limit: **30% extra work** per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 20 carpets normal → Max +6 carpets overtime = 26 total/month.\n",
    "  * If all 30 workers do overtime → +180 carpets max.\n",
    "  * Total monthly capacity = 600 normal + 180 overtime = 780 carpets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: **Hiring / Firing Workers**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hire temporarily when demand > capacity.\n",
    "* Fire when demand decreases.\n",
    "* **Hiring cost**: ₹3,200 per worker (in addition to salary).\n",
    "* **Firing cost**: ₹4,000 per worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: **Inventory / Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make extra carpets in one month, store for future demand.\n",
    "* **Storage cost**: ₹80 per carpet per month.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* LP can model complex production planning with varying demand, workforce changes, overtime, and storage.\n",
    "* Overtime is cheaper for small surpluses than hiring/firing.\n",
    "* Inventory allows shifting production across months but costs money.\n",
    "* Workforce adjustments have fixed hiring/firing costs, so not always optimal to change frequently.\n",
    "* LP solves continuous relaxations efficiently; ILP is much harder."
