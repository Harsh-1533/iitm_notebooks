    "\n",
    "  * A–B gets 7 Mbps, A–C gets 3 Mbps, B–C gets least.\n",
    "  * Higher-revenue links favored (A–C), but actual allocation depends on network constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **11. Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fractional solutions are fine** (bandwidth can be split).\n",
    "* In optimal solutions, **most edges are saturated** (capacity fully used) except possibly one.\n",
    "* Even though A–C has highest revenue per Mbps, constraints may cause higher allocation to other routes.\n",
    "* The LP approach **works for small networks**, but…\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **12. Scalability Issue**\n",
    "\n",
    "* This LP model creates **one variable per possible route** between a pair of nodes.\n",
    "* In larger graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Number of possible paths grows **exponentially**.\n",
    "  * The LP size becomes huge and computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **13. Better Approach – Network Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of defining a variable for **every path**, model problem as a **network flow problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Flow directly on edges.\n",
    "  * Apply **max-flow / min-cost flow algorithms**.\n",
    "* Network flow methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * More scalable.\n",
    "  * Handle large graphs efficiently.\n",
    "* This bandwidth allocation is essentially a **network flow problem** with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Multiple demands (A–B, A–C, B–C)\n",
    "  * Capacities\n",
    "  * Minimum required flows\n",
    "  * Revenue (cost/profit per flow)\n",

    "✅ **Final Takeaway:**\n",
    "This LP formulation is an important educational example of modeling **bandwidth allocation** in terms of **variables, capacity constraints, service requirements, and an objective function**.\n",
    "However, for large-scale real-world networks, **network flow algorithms** (like min-cost max-flow) are preferred due to better scalability."
