    "\n",
    "* The process above is an example of **duality**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Every LP (called the **primal**) has a **dual** problem.\n",
    "  * Solving the dual gives bounds on the primal’s optimum.\n",

    "* Constraints can be combined to bound the objective (basis of duality).\n",
    "* Duality provides a powerful tool for proving optimality."
