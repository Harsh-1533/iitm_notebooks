    "### **1. Background: Intractable Problems and Checking Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Intractable Problem**:\n",
    "  A problem that seems to require *exponential* or *super-polynomial* time to solve in the worst case.\n",
    "* Even for intractable problems, sometimes we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Checking algorithm** (or verification algorithm):\n",
    "    Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Input instance** `x`\n",
    "    * **Claimed solution** `S`\n",
    "      We can verify if `S` is a valid solution for `x` in **polynomial time**.\n",
    "* **Important property**:\n",
    "  For a problem to have an efficient checking algorithm,\n",
    "  the **certificate** (i.e., claimed solution `S`) must be small — polynomial in the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example of what’s *not* allowed:\n",
    "    “Shortest path” check by giving *all possible paths* is infeasible — certificate too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Class NP**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition (informal)**:\n",
    "  The class of decision problems for which a claimed solution can be **verified** in *polynomial time*.\n",
    "* **Verification time complexity**: `O(poly(n))` where `n` is the size of the input.\n",
    "* **Certificate size**: Must be polynomial in the input size.\n",
    "* **Examples of NP problems**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Factorization**\n",
    "     Input: integer `n`\n",
    "     Claim: `p` and `q` such that `p*q = n` and both `p`, `q` are prime.\n",
    "     Check: Multiply `p` and `q`, confirm primality — polynomial.\n",
    "  2. **Boolean Satisfiability (SAT)**\n",
    "     Input: Boolean formula in CNF.\n",
    "     Claim: Assignment to variables.\n",
    "     Check: Substitute and evaluate formula — polynomial.\n",
    "  3. **Travelling Salesman (decision version)**\n",
    "     Input: Graph with distances, bound `k`.\n",
    "     Claim: Tour length ≤ `k`.\n",
    "     Check: Sum distances, compare — polynomial.\n",
    "  4. **Vertex Cover / Independent Set (decision version)**\n",
    "     Input: Graph `G`, bound `k`.\n",
    "     Claim: Set of vertices of size ≤ `k` that covers edges (or independent set of size ≥ `k`).\n",
    "     Check: Verify property — polynomial.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Class P**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**:\n",
    "  Problems that can be **solved** (not just verified) in polynomial time by a deterministic algorithm.\n",
    "* **Relation between P and NP**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Any problem in **P** is also in **NP**.\n",
    "  * Reason: If you can *solve* in poly-time, you can certainly *verify* in poly-time by solving and comparing.\n",
    "  * Thus: $P \\subseteq NP$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. The P vs NP Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Main Question**: Is $P = NP$?\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Equivalent: Does *every* problem with an efficient verification algorithm also have an efficient solution algorithm?\n",
    "* **Intuition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Generation (finding a solution) seems harder than checking.\n",
    "  * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Multiplying primes is easy (check factorization).\n",
    "    * Finding primes from their product (factoring) seems hard.\n",
    "* **Belief**: $P \\neq NP$\n",
    "  (We believe checking is easier than generating.)\n",
    "* **Status**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * No proof yet.\n",
    "  * One of the **Millennium Prize Problems** — worth \\$1 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. NP-Completeness**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many intractable problems seem related in hardness.\n",
    "* **Inter-reducibility**:\n",
    "  Problem A can be **reduced** to problem B if:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Any instance of A can be transformed to an instance of B in polynomial time.\n",
    "  * If B can be solved efficiently, then A can be solved efficiently.\n",
    "* If two problems reduce to each other: they are equally hard (or equally easy).\n",
    "* **Key examples from lecture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Vertex Cover ↔ Independent Set (mutual reductions)\n",
    "  * SAT → 3-SAT\n",
    "    3-SAT: SAT where each clause has ≤ 3 literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Example: SAT to 3-SAT Reduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why?** To show 3-SAT is as hard as SAT.\n",
    "* **Method**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If clause has > 3 literals, split using new variables.\n",
    "  * Example: Clause $(x_1 \\vee x_2 \\vee x_3 \\vee x_4 \\vee x_5)$\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Introduce new literal $A$:\n",
    "       $(x_1 \\vee x_2 \\vee A)$ ∧ $(\\lnot A \\vee x_3 \\vee x_4 \\vee x_5)$\n",
    "    2. Keep splitting clauses > 3 literals by introducing new variables until all clauses have ≤ 3 literals.\n",
    "  * New formula is satisfiable **iff** original formula is satisfiable.\n",
    "* **Conclusion**: SAT reduces to 3-SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Example: 3-SAT to Independent Set Reduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Setup**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Given 3-SAT formula (clauses with ≤ 3 literals).\n",
    "* **Graph construction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. For each clause, create a **triangle** (node for each literal).\n",
    "  2. Connect a literal to the **negation** of that literal in any other clause (cross-clause edges).\n",
    "* **Observation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An **independent set** can pick at most one vertex from each triangle (clause).\n",
    "  * Picking one per clause corresponds to choosing one literal per clause to make true.\n",
    "  * Cross edges enforce consistency between clauses (no literal and its negation both picked).\n",
    "* **Conclusion**:\n",
    "  Finding an independent set of size = number of clauses solves the 3-SAT instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Transitive Reductions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reductions are **transitive**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If SAT → 3-SAT and 3-SAT → Independent Set,\n",
    "    then SAT → Independent Set.\n",
    "  * Also: Independent Set ↔ Vertex Cover, so SAT → Vertex Cover.\n",
    "* Means: Solving any one NP-complete problem efficiently solves all of them.\n",

    "  Every problem in NP can be reduced to SAT.\n",
    "* **Consequence**:\n",
    "  SAT is **NP-complete**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * SAT ∈ NP (easy to check solutions).\n",
    "  * All NP problems reduce to SAT.\n",
    "* **By reductions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 3-SAT is also NP-complete (SAT → 3-SAT).\n",

    "### **10. Proving NP-Completeness**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To prove problem B is NP-complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Show **B ∈ NP** (has poly-time checking algorithm).\n",
    "  2. Reduce a known NP-complete problem A to B in poly-time.\n",
    "* Once you have one NP-complete problem (SAT), you can use it as a base to prove others NP-complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **11. NP-Complete Problems in Practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many real-world problems are NP-complete:\n",

    "  * **Scheduling** (optimal scheduling with constraints)\n",
    "  * **Bin Packing** (e.g., furniture moving with limited truck space)\n",
    "  * **Travelling Salesman** (shortest tour visiting all cities)\n",
    "  * **Integer Linear Programming** (with integer constraints)\n",
    "* These problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Have been studied for centuries.\n",
    "  * Are commercially important.\n",
    "  * Still no efficient algorithms found → supports belief that $P \\neq NP$.\n",
