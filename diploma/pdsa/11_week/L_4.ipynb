    "\n",
    "### **1. Introduction to Network Flows**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Basic Idea:**\n",
    "  A network flow problem involves moving as much quantity (e.g., oil, water, internet data) as possible from a **source node** $s$ to a **target/sink node** $t$ through a **directed graph**.\n",
    "* **Motivation Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Pipelines:** Nodes = junctions, Edges = pipelines with capacities.\n",
    "  * Goal = Maximize total amount transported from $s$ to $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Model Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Graph:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Directed graph $G = (V, E)$\n",
    "  * Each edge $e$ has a **capacity** $c(e)$ — maximum amount it can carry.\n",
    "* **Flow Assignment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A **flow** is a function $f: E \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$\n",
    "  * **Capacity constraint:** $f(e) \\leq c(e)$ for all $e \\in E$\n",
    "* **Flow Conservation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For all nodes $v \\in V \\setminus \\{s, t\\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\sum_{u: (u,v) \\in E} f(u,v) = \\sum_{w: (v,w) \\in E} f(v,w)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    i.e., **incoming flow = outgoing flow** at all intermediate nodes (no storage allowed).\n",
    "  * Source $s$: Outflow – Inflow = Total flow sent.\n",
    "  * Sink $t$: Inflow – Outflow = Total flow received.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Measuring the Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Value of a flow $|f|$:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  |f| = \\sum_{(s,v) \\in E} f(s,v) \\quad \\text{(outflow from source)}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  or equivalently:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  |f| = \\sum_{(u,t) \\in E} f(u,t) \\quad \\text{(inflow to sink)}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "* **Goal:**\n",
    "  Maximize $|f|$ subject to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Capacity constraints.\n",
    "  * Flow conservation constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. LP Formulation of Maximum Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variables:** $f_{uv}$ for each edge $(u,v)$\n",
    "* **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Capacity:**\n",
    "     $0 \\leq f_{uv} \\leq c_{uv}$\n",
    "  2. **Conservation:** For every intermediate node $v$:\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\sum_{u} f_{uv} = \\sum_{w} f_{vw}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "* **Objective:**\n",
    "  Maximize $\\sum_{(s,v) \\in E} f_{sv}$\n",
    "  (total outflow from $s$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Limitations of LP Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Earlier bandwidth allocation used **paths** as variables — too many (exponential count).\n",
    "* Edge-based LP solves that but still requires LP solver (e.g., Simplex).\n",
    "* Leads to **need for direct algorithm** → Ford–Fulkerson.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Ford–Fulkerson Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:** Start with zero flow, repeatedly find **augmenting paths** from $s$ to $t$, and push as much flow as possible along them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: $f(e) = 0$ for all edges.\n",
    "2. **Find an augmenting path** $P$ in the **residual graph** (defined below).\n",
    "3. **Bottleneck capacity** $\\Delta = \\min\\limits_{e \\in P} \\{ \\text{residual capacity}(e) \\}$.\n",
    "4. **Augment**: For each forward edge $(u,v)$ in $P$, increase $f(u,v)$ by $\\Delta$. For each backward edge $(v,u)$, decrease $f(v,u)$ by $\\Delta$.\n",
    "5. **Repeat** until no augmenting path exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Residual Graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** Given current flow $f$, the residual graph $G_f$ has:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Forward edges:** $(u,v)$ with capacity $c(u,v) - f(u,v)$ (unused capacity).\n",
    "  * **Backward edges:** $(v,u)$ with capacity $f(u,v)$ (allow reducing previous flow).\n",
    "* **Purpose:** Models all possible ways to adjust the current flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Example Flow Adjustment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wrong initial choice:** Picking a suboptimal path can block capacity.\n",
    "* **Recovery:** Residual graph allows reversing earlier decisions by sending flow back along backward edges.\n",
    "* This flexibility ensures we can reach optimal flow even if early choices were bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Termination**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stop when no path from $s$ to $t$ exists in the residual graph.\n",
    "* Total flow = sum of flows out of $s$ (or into $t$) in the final solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Min-Cut and Max-Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cut:** A partition $(S, T)$ of vertices with $s \\in S, t \\in T$.\n",
    "  **Capacity of cut**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  c(S, T) = \\sum_{u \\in S, v \\in T} c(u,v)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "* **Observation:** Any $s$-$t$ flow must cross every cut from $S$ to $T$, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  |f| \\leq \\text{capacity of any cut}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "* **Minimum cut:** Cut with smallest capacity.\n",
    "* **Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem:**\n",
    "  The maximum flow value equals the capacity of the minimum cut:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\max\\limits_{f} |f| = \\min\\limits_{\\text{cuts }(S,T)} c(S,T)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "* **Consequences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Min-cut capacity is an upper bound on flow.\n",
    "  * Ford–Fulkerson yields both max flow and (by theorem) the min-cut capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. Efficiency Issues with Ford–Fulkerson**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** If we always choose a bad augmenting path, flow increases very slowly.\n",
    "* **Example:** If bottleneck = 1 in each augmentation, it could take $O(|f^*|)$ iterations, where $|f^*|$ is max flow value.\n",
    "* **Extreme case:** Capacity values large → algorithm depends on magnitude of capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **12. Edmonds–Karp Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Heuristic:** Always choose the **shortest augmenting path** (in terms of number of edges) using **BFS**.\n",
    "* **Benefit:** Avoids slow progress; guarantees:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Time complexity} = O(VE^2)\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  independent of actual capacity values.\n",
    "* **Reason:** Shortest paths prevent cycles of repeatedly undoing long detours.\n",
    "\n",
