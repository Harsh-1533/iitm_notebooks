    "## **PDSA – Reductions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Introduction to Reductions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Concept:**\n",
    "  A *reduction* is a way of solving a problem **A** by transforming it into another problem **B** for which we already have a solution.\n",
    "* **Motivation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We may already know efficient algorithms for **B** (e.g., network flow, linear programming).\n",
    "  * If we can translate **A** into **B** efficiently, we can use the solver for **B** and then translate the result back to a solution for **A**.\n",
    "  * This avoids inventing a new algorithm from scratch for **A**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Example Problem: Teachers and Subjects**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Given:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 5 teachers and 5 subjects.\n",
    "  * Each teacher is capable of teaching a subset of subjects.\n",
    "  * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Deb: English, History\n",
    "    * Priya: Biology, Maths\n",
    "    * Kumar: Maths\n",
    "    * Sheila: History\n",
    "    * Aziz: Physics\n",
    "* **Goal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Assign each subject to exactly **one teacher**.\n",
    "  * Each teacher gets exactly **one subject** that they are willing to teach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* One instructor per course.\n",
    "* One course per instructor.\n",
    "* Allocations must follow given teacher–subject capability edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Bipartite Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have two disjoint sets of vertices:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * $V_0$: Teachers\n",
    "  * $V_1$: Courses\n",
    "* Edges connect **only** from $V_0$ to $V_1$ (no edges within a set).\n",
    "* **Matching:** A subset of edges such that **no two edges share an endpoint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If edge (Priya, Biology) is chosen, no other edge involving Priya or Biology can be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If Aziz can only teach Physics, assign (Aziz, Physics).\n",
    "* Priya → Biology.\n",
    "* Sheila → History.\n",
    "* Deb → English.\n",
    "* Kumar → Maths.\n",
    "* Result: Every teacher is assigned a subject, every subject has a teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Case – **Perfect Matching**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A matching where every vertex in $V_0$ and $V_1$ is matched.\n",
    "* Possible when $|V_0| = |V_1|$ and a complete matching exists.\n",
    "* In this example, the perfect matching covers all 5 teachers and 5 subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Applications of Bipartite Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Resource Allocation Problems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Teachers → Subjects\n",
    "  * Drivers → Vehicles (driver can only drive certain vehicles)\n",
    "  * Students → Institutions (with preferences)\n",
    "* Generalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Can be many-to-one (e.g., multiple students per institution), but the matching definition changes accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Reduction to Network Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Network Flow Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Elements:** source node (s), sink node (t), edges with capacities.\n",
    "* **Flow constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Capacity constraint: Flow ≤ capacity.\n",
    "  * Conservation constraint: For all intermediate nodes, inflow = outflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Converting Bipartite Matching to Network Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a **source node** $s$ and connect it to all vertices in $V_0$ (teachers).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Capacity = 1 for each edge.\n",
    "2. Connect all vertices in $V_1$ (subjects) to a **sink node** $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Capacity = 1 for each edge.\n",
    "3. Between $V_0$ and $V_1$, keep the given capability edges (teacher–subject edges), each with capacity 1.\n",
    "4. **Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each edge with flow = 1 corresponds to a teacher–subject assignment.\n",
    "   * Capacity 1 ensures no teacher or subject can take more than one assignment.\n",
    "5. **Max Flow ↔ Maximum Matching:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The size of the maximum matching = maximum flow value from $s$ to $t$.\n",
    "   * If max flow = $|V_0| = |V_1|$, then a **perfect matching** exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Reduction – Formal Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A reduces to B** if:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We can transform any instance of **A** into an instance of **B** in **polynomial time**.\n",
    "  * We can transform a solution for **B** back into a solution for **A** in **polynomial time**.\n",
    "* **Meaning:** If we have an efficient solver for **B**, we automatically get an efficient solver for **A**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Efficiency Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **translation time** (A → B and B → A) must be **polynomial** in the size of the input.\n",
    "* The **size of the instance** of **B** should be polynomial in the size of **A**.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Bipartite matching → Network flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Add one source, one sink, edges with capacities.\n",
    "    * Number of nodes/edges grows linearly.\n",
    "  * Maximum flow → Linear programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * One variable per edge.\n",
    "    * Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "      * **Capacity constraints**: one per edge.\n",
    "      * **Conservation constraints**: one per vertex.\n",
    "    * Both variables and constraints grow linearly.\n",

    "### 8. **Two Uses of Reductions**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(a) Positive Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To **solve** a problem **A** by using an existing efficient algorithm for **B**.\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Bipartite matching → Network flow → Ford–Fulkerson algorithm.\n",
    "  * Maximum flow → Linear programming → Simplex method.\n",
    "* Practical:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Many efficient solvers for standard problems are available (e.g., Python LP solvers, network flow libraries).\n",
    "  * If we can model a problem as one of these standard problems, we can solve it using available tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **(b) Hardness Argument**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To **prove that a problem is hard**.\n",
    "* If:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **A** is known to be hard.\n",
    "  * **A reduces to B**.\n",
    "* Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If **B** were easy, **A** would be easy (via the reduction).\n",
    "  * But since **A** is hard, **B** must also be hard.\n",
    "* This is a standard technique in complexity theory (used for NP-hardness proofs).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Important Takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduction is a mapping**: Problem A → Problem B.\n",
    "* **Forward direction:** Use B’s solver to solve A efficiently.\n",
    "* **Reverse direction:** Use A’s known hardness to prove B’s hardness.\n",
    "* **Efficiency condition:** Transformations and solution reconstruction must be polynomial time.\n",
    "* **Practical tip:** Learn to recognize when your problem can be modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Network flow\n",
    "  * Linear programming\n",
    "  * Matching\n",
    "  * Or other well-studied problems with ready-made solvers.\n",
