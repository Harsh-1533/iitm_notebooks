    "## **üìå Representing Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "To process and analyze graphs, we must first **represent** them in a format suitable for computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Working with Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs consist of vertices and edges. Efficient graph algorithms depend heavily on how we **represent the graph** in memory. The two most common representations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adjacency Matrix**\n",
    "* **Adjacency List**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Adjacency Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represented as a **2D array** (or matrix) of size $n \\times n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices.\n",
    "* Entry $AMat[i][j] = 1$ if there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, otherwise 0.\n",
    "* Applicable for **dense graphs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast lookup: Checking if an edge exists between $i$ and $j$ takes **O(1)** time.\n",
    "* Easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* High space usage: Requires $O(n^2)$ space even for sparse graphs.\n",
    "* Inefficient for large, sparse graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Computing with Adjacency Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reachability**: Can be computed using matrix powers (e.g., Warshall‚Äôs algorithm or BFS/DFS).\n",
    "* **Graph algorithms** like Floyd-Warshall (for shortest paths) work directly with adjacency matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Adjacency List**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A more space-efficient representation using a **dictionary of lists**.\n",
    "* For each vertex $i$, `AList[i]` stores the list of all **neighboring vertices** (i.e., directly connected nodes).\n",
    "* Ideal for **sparse graphs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Space efficient: Requires only $O(n + m)$ where $m$ is number of edges.\n",
    "* Easy to iterate over neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Edge existence check takes $O(\\text{degree of } i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Checking Reachability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reachability means determining whether there's a **path** from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$.\n",
    "* Can be done via:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Depth-First Search (DFS)**\n",
    "  * **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**\n",
    "* In adjacency list: Traverse neighbors recursively/iteratively.\n",
    "* In adjacency matrix: Use marking or boolean matrix multiplication.\n",

    "\n",
    "* To work with graphs programmatically, **graph representations** are essential.\n",
    "* **Adjacency Matrix**: Good for fast edge checks but uses more space.\n",
    "* **Adjacency List**: Efficient for sparse graphs and practical for most applications.\n",
    "* **Reachability**: Can be computed via marking (BFS/DFS) using either representation.\n",
    "* Choice of representation impacts **performance**, **storage**, and **algorithm design**.\n",
