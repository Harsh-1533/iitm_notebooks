    "A **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** is a **directed graph** that **has no cycles**.\n",

    "### üîπ **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **graph** is a collection of **nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges**.\n",
    "* A **directed graph** has edges with a direction (from one node to another).\n",
    "* A **DAG** is a directed graph where:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Edges have a direction.\n",
    "  * **No path** from a node leads **back to itself** (i.e., **no cycles**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a **DAG** if there are **no directed cycles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ **Properties of DAGs**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ‚úÖ **No cycles** ‚Äî you cannot revisit the same node following the direction of edges.\n",
    "2. ‚úÖ **Has at least one node with in-degree 0** (a starting point).\n",
    "3. ‚úÖ **Topological sorting is possible** ‚Äî a linear ordering of nodes such that all edges go from earlier to later in the order.\n",
    "4. ‚úÖ Used in many **real-world systems** where dependency ordering matters.\n",

    "* **Task scheduling** (some tasks must be done before others).\n",
    "* **Build systems** (e.g., CMake, Makefile dependencies).\n",
    "* **Git version history** (commits form a DAG).\n",

    "\n",
    "A **topological sort** of a DAG is an ordering of vertices $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ such that **for every edge** $(u, v)$, $u$ comes **before** $v$.\n",
