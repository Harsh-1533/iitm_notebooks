    "\n",
    "**Topological Sorting** is a linear ordering of the **vertices** of a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** such that for every **directed edge** $u \\rightarrow v$, vertex $u$ comes **before** vertex $v$ in the ordering.\n",

    "### ðŸ”‘ **When Is Topological Sorting Possible?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological sorting is only possible **if and only if** the graph is a **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph).\n",
    "If the graph contains a **cycle**, topological sort **does not exist**.\n",
