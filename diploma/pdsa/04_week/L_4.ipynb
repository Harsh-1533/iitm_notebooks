    "## üîç What is Depth First Search (DFS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS is a **graph traversal algorithm** that explores **as far as possible along each branch before backtracking**. Think of it like exploring a maze ‚Äî you go down one path until you hit a dead end, then backtrack and try another path.\n",
