    "# **üìå Introduction to Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are powerful mathematical structures used to model **relationships** and **interactions** among objects. They are widely used in fields like computer science, network theory, social science, biology, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Graph Basics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **Graph** is made up of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Vertices (Nodes)**: Represent the entities (e.g., people, cities, web pages).\n",
    "  * **Edges (Links)**: Represent the relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Types of Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Directed Graph (Digraph)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Edges have a direction.\n",
    "  * Example: A is a parent of B ‚Üí A ‚Üí B\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Undirected Graph**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Edges do not have direction.\n",
    "  * Example: A is a friend of B ‚Üî A‚ÄîB\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Graph Type | Representation | Example             |\n",
    "| ---------- | -------------- | ------------------- |\n",
    "| Directed   | (A ‚Üí B)        | Twitter follow      |\n",
    "| Undirected | (A ‚Äî B)        | Facebook friendship |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Visualizing Relations as Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Any relationship between entities can be visualized using graphs.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Social networks\n",
    "* Webpage links (directed)\n",
    "* Road networks (can be directed or undirected)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **node** represents an entity, and **edges** show how they are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Reachability**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reachability** asks the question:\n",
    "*\"Can we reach node `v` starting from node `u`?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "* If yes, there exists a **path** (a sequence of edges).\n",
    "* Reachability is important in:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Web crawlers\n",
    "  * Routing algorithms\n",
    "  * Network connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graph: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C\n",
    "* Reachable from A to C? ‚úÖ Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Graph Colouring**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph colouring** is the process of assigning colours to nodes such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No two adjacent vertices have the same colour.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Register allocation in compilers\n",
    "* Map colouring\n",
    "* Scheduling problems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph with 3 connected nodes (triangle):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires 3 colours (since all nodes are connected)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Vertex Cover**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vertex cover** is a set of vertices such that **every edge in the graph** is incident to **at least one vertex in the set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Goal: Find the **minimum vertex cover**\n",
    "* NP-complete problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Placing guards in a museum (each hallway must be watched by at least one guard)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Independent Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **independent set** is a set of vertices such that **no two vertices** in the set are adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Opposite of vertex cover\n",
    "* Also an NP-complete problem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a triangle graph, only 1 node can be in the independent set.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **matching** is a set of **edges** such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No two edges share a vertex\n",
    "\n",
    "Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maximum Matching**: Largest possible matching\n",
    "* **Perfect Matching**: Every vertex is matched\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Job assignment\n",
    "* Marriage problem (stable matching)\n",
    "* Bipartite graphs (Hungarian algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **üìù Lecture Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graphs model entities (vertices) and their relationships (edges)\n",
    "* Can be directed or undirected\n",
    "* Paths and reachability form the foundation of many graph-based problems\n",
    "* Additional important problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Graph colouring**\n",
    "  * **Vertex cover**\n",
    "  * **Independent set**\n",
    "  * **Matching**\n",
