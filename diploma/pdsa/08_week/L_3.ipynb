    "\n",
    "Given two large integers `x` and `y`, how can we multiply them faster than the traditional school method?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† **1. The Naive (Grade-School) Multiplication**\n",
    "\n",
    "In school, we learned to multiply numbers by forming partial products.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "      23\n",
    "    √ó 14\n",
    "  _______\n",
    "      92   ‚Üê 23 √ó 4 (unit digit)\n",

    "  _______\n",
    "     322\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each digit of the second number is multiplied with the entire first number, resulting in *n* partial products (if both have *n* digits), and then added together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üßÆ Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `x` and `y` are `n`-digit numbers (in base 10 or binary),\n",
    "* Each partial product takes O(n),\n",
    "* You generate and add `n` such products.\n",
    "\n",
    "üî∫ **Total Time: O(n¬≤)**\n",

    "* 12 = `1100` (binary)\n",

    "* Split the problem into smaller subproblems\n",
    "* Solve them recursively\n",
    "* Combine results\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for multiplying two `n`-bit numbers `x` and `y`, **split each number into two `n/2`-bit parts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = x1 √ó 2^(n/2) + x0  \n",
