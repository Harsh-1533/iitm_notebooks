    "# PDSA Notes: Divide and Conquer - Counting Inversions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Divide and Conquer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divide and Conquer** is an algorithmic design paradigm where a problem is broken into smaller, disjoint sub-problems, each solved independently, and the results are then combined efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Divide:** Split the problem into sub-problems.\n",
    "* **Conquer:** Solve each sub-problem independently.\n",
    "* **Combine:** Merge the sub-solutions into a final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Merge Sort:** Splits the list into halves, sorts each half, and merges them.\n",
    "* **Quick Sort:** Partitions based on a pivot, then recursively sorts partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Real-world Motivation: Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Systems like Amazon and Netflix recommend items by comparing user profiles.\n",
    "* A profile is based on **ranking or rating** of items (e.g., movies).\n",
    "* To find similar users, we compare rankings to determine how alike they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Comparing Rankings: Inversions\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose 5 movies A, B, C, D, E are ranked by two users:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **You:** D, B, C, A, E → (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "* **Friend:** B, A, C, D, E → (2, 4, 3, 1, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inversion:** A pair of items (i, j) such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You prefer i over j\n",
    "  * Your friend prefers j over i\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "From your ranking (1,2,3,4,5) and your friend's (2,4,3,1,5):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inversions: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (3,4) → Total: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "### Range of Inversions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Minimum:** 0 (identical rankings)\n",
    "* **Maximum:** n(n-1)/2 (completely opposite rankings)\n",
    "\n",
    "This count becomes a **measure of dissimilarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Problem Reformulation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fix your ranking as 1 to n.\n",
    "* Your friend's ranking becomes a **permutation** of 1 to n.\n",
    "* Count how many pairs (i, j) exist such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * i < j but in the permutation, i appears after j.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the number of **inversions** in the permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Brute Force Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare all pairs (i, j), i < j\n",
    "* Check if i appears after j in the permutation\n",
    "* **Time complexity:** O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Efficient Approach: Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort Style)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a modified **Merge Sort** to count inversions efficiently.\n",
    "* **Divide:** Split array into two halves.\n",
    "* **Conquer:** Recursively count inversions in both halves.\n",
    "* **Combine:** Count inversions **across** the left and right halves during merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight During Merge:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When picking an element from the **right half** before elements in the **left**, it means inversion.\n",
    "* Count how many elements in the left are greater than the picked right element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Merge and Count: Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Left: \\[1, 3, 7]\n",
    "* Right: \\[2, 6, 8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compare 1 and 2 → 1 < 2, no inversion.\n",
    "2. Compare 3 and 2 → 3 > 2 → 2 has overtaken 3 and 7 → 2 inversions.\n",
    "3. Continue this process, updating inversion count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total inversions calculated during merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Implementation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function: merge\\_and\\_count(A, B)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A, B: sorted lists\n",
    "* Merge them into sorted list C\n",
    "* For each element picked from B (right list) before A (left list):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Count = (number of remaining elements in A)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function: sort\\_and\\_count(arr)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If list size = 1: return list, 0\n",
    "* Split list into two halves\n",
    "* Recursively sort\\_and\\_count each half\n",
    "* Use merge\\_and\\_count to merge and count cross-inversions\n",
    "* Total inversion = left inversions + right inversions + cross-inversions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Same recurrence as Merge Sort:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)\n",
    "  * **T(n) = O(n log n)**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "| Approach       | Output                      | Time Complexity |\n",
    "| -------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |\n",
    "| Brute Force    | Explicit list of inversions | O(n^2)          |\n",
    "| Divide-Conquer | Total inversion count       | O(n log n)      |\n",
    "\n",
    "* Brute force gives **all inversion pairs**, but is slow.\n",
    "* Divide and conquer gives **just the count**, but is fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Application in Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* We do **not** need the exact pairs of disagreements.\n",
    "* We only need the **count of inversions** to determine **similarity**.\n",
    "* Divide and conquer method is **optimal** for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inversions measure dissimilarity in rankings.\n",
    "* Naive comparison takes O(n^2) time.\n",
    "* Modified merge sort (sort and count) achieves O(n log n).\n",
    "* Efficient for applications like recommender systems where only count matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Final Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Divide and conquer is powerful when the **merge** step can be optimized.\n",
    "* Merge and count combines sorting with inversion counting.\n",
    "* Can be extended to other problems involving **pairwise relationships**.\n",
