    "## ✅ What is Selection Sort?\n",
    "- Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first unsorted element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 How Selection Sort Works — Step by Step:\n",
    "Assume you have an array:\n",
    "`[29, 10, 14, 37, 14]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First pass:\n",
    "    - Find the smallest element in the whole array → `10`\n",
    "    - Swap it with the first element → `[10, 29, 14, 37, 14]`\n",
    "2. Second pass:\n",
    "    - Find the smallest from index 1 to end → `14`\n",
    "    - Swap with index 1 → `[10, 14, 29, 37, 14]`\n",
    "3. Third pass:\n",
    "    - Smallest from index 2 to end → `14`\n",
    "    - Swap with index 2 → `[10, 14, 14, 37, 29]`\n",
    "4. Fourth pass:\n",
    "    - Smallest from index 3 to end → `29`\n",
    "    - Swap with index 3 → `[10, 14, 14, 29, 37]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the array is sorted."

    "## 📌 When is Selection Sort Not Stable?\n",
    "- Selection Sort is not stable when it swaps an element with a non-adjacent smaller element that has the same value as another earlier element.\n",
    "This breaks the original relative order of equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❗ Rule:\n",
    "- If Selection Sort swaps an element forward past another identical element, their relative order gets reversed — this causes instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Example:\n",
    "Let’s take this input:\n",
    "`[4a, 4b, 3, 5, 6]`\n",
    "- `4a` and `4b` are two different `4`s, but we tag them (`a`, `b`) to track their original positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔁 First Pass:\n",
    "- Minimum is `3` at index 2\n",
    "- Swap `3` with `4a`\n",
    "- Array becomes:\n",
    "`[3, 4b, 4a, 5, 6]`\n",
    "- Now `4a` comes after `4b`, even though it was before originally.\n",
    "- ➡️ Relative order broken → Not stable\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ In contrast — When Selection Sort is stable:\n",
    "- If no such swap happens that moves an equal element before its original peer, stability is preserved. For example:\n",
    "- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
    "- There are no duplicates, so no chance to break relative order → Stable in effect (but not by design)."
