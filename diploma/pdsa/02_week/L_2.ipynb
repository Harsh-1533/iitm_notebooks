    "## 🔍 1. What are Orders of Magnitude?\n",
    "- **Definition**: An order of magnitude refers to the scale or growth rate of an algorithm’s time or space complexity.\n",
    "- It shows **how an algorithm's performance changes** as input size increases.\n",
    "- Commonly expressed in **Big-O notation**:  \n",
    "  - O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 2. Comparing Orders of Magnitude\n",
    "- Used to compare the **efficiency of different algorithms**.\n",
    "- Example Order (from fastest to slowest growth):\n",
    "    - $ O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(2ⁿ)$\n",
    "    - Even if two algorithms solve the same problem, the one with the lower order of magnitude will scale better.\n",
    "    - Lower order = better performance on large inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📏 3. Upper Bounds (Big-O)\n",
    "- Big-O gives the **maximum possible growth rate** of an algorithm.\n",
    "- Describes the **worst-case** time or space complexity.\n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "If $`T(n) = 3n + 5`$, then $`T(n) = O(n)`$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📉 4. Lower Bounds (Big-Ω)\n",
    "- Describes the **minimum possible time** an algorithm will take.\n",
    "- Refers to the **best-case** scenario.\n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "If the algorithm always checks only one item, then $`Ω(1)`$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 5. Tight Bounds (Big-Θ)\n",
    "- Used when both the **upper and lower bounds are the same**.\n",
    "- Gives an **exact bound** on the growth rate.\n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "If $`T(n) = 2n + 3`$, then $`T(n) = Θ(n)`$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 6. Useful Properties\n",
    "- Constant factors are **ignored** in asymptotic analysis:\n",
    "- $O(3n²) → O(n²)$\n",
    "- Lower-order terms are **ignored**:\n",
    "- $O(n² + n) → O(n²)$\n",
    "- **Transitivity**:\n",
    "- If $f(n) = O(g(n))$ and $g(n) = O(h(n))$, then $f(n) = O(h(n))$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 7. Example for Practice\n",
    "**You have two algorithms:**\n",
    "- Algorithm A: O(n²)\n",
    "- Algorithm B: O(n log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Which is better for large $`n`$?  \n",
    "**✅ Answer:** Algorithm B (since $`n log n`$ < $`n²`$ for large inputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Summary\n",
    "- Use **orders of magnitude** to compare algorithm scalability.\n",
    "- **Big-O**: Worst-case\n",
    "- **Big-Ω**: Best-case\n",
    "- **Big-Θ**: Exact-case\n",
    "- Choose algorithms with **lower complexity** for better performance."
